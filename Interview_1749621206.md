*(The Director's voice, calm and clear, begins)*

Welcome, Alex. The stage is set.

The soft hum of the city is already a distant memory as you step off the elevator on the 10th floor of the Innovate Solutions building. It’s 8:30 AM, and the office is just starting to fill with the quiet murmur of early birds and the clatter of coffee mugs. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee hangs in the air, mingling with the subtle scent of new carpeting and ambition.

You take a moment to survey the sleek, open-plan office. Glass walls separate meeting rooms, and ergonomic desks stretch out in neat rows. Your calendar for the day, already buzzing in your mind, is packed. First up: finalize the preliminary market research for the 'Eco-Growth Initiative' project by 10 AM, then a team sync with Mark at 11 AM to discuss the initial client presentation structure.

As you approach your desk, you see a small, sticky note from Sarah, your project lead, attached to your monitor: "Alex, quick chat about the Eco-Growth data when you get in? Room 3B, 9 AM sharp. – S."

You glance at your watch. 8:35 AM. You have a little over 20 minutes before the meeting with Sarah.

What do you do first?

1.  Head straight to the coffee machine to grab a much-needed caffeine boost before anything else.
2.  Go to your desk, quickly review the sticky note, and immediately start pulling up the Eco-Growth data to prepare for Sarah.
3.  Swing by Mark's desk (if he's in) to briefly touch base about the 11 AM sync, just to confirm you're on the same page.
4.  Check your inbox for any urgent emails that might have come in overnight.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
