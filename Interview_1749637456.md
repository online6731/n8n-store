 

Hello, Alex. Welcome to your interview for the Senior Project Manager position at Innovate Inc.

My name is Elara, and I'll be guiding you through a work-life simulation designed to understand your approach to various professional situations. This is a practical assessment of the emotional intelligence competencies required for this role.

The simulation consists of 10 scenarios. In each, you'll interact with colleagues, manage challenges, and make decisions just as you would on the job. There are no right or wrong answers, only your authentic responses. Your performance in one scenario may influence events in later ones.

Let's begin.

**Scenario 1 of 10: The Unexpected Feedback**

It's Monday morning. You've been in your role for a few months and are settling in. You sit down at your desk, ready to start the week. Your direct team lead, Michael, has just sent you a calendar invitation for a "Quick Sync" in 15 minutes with no other context. Before you can think too much about it, you see an email notification pop up. It's from Michael as well, with the subject line "Project Phoenix - Weekend Thoughts."

You open the email. In it, Michael praises the team's effort on Project Phoenix but includes a line that catches you off guard: "While the project is on track, I've noticed a tendency for your communication to be a bit too direct in team meetings, which may be affecting team morale. Let's discuss this and other things in our sync."

You have a few minutes before the meeting. What is your immediate focus?

1.  Open the Project Phoenix files and review your recent communications to find examples of what Michael might be referring to.
2.  Dismiss the comment for now. He said the project is on track, which is the main thing. Use the time to prepare your own agenda for the "Quick Sync."
3.  Feel a surge of defensiveness and immediately start drafting a reply to his email to justify your communication style before the meeting.
4.  Take a few deep breaths and reflect on your recent meetings. Try to honestly assess if your communication could be perceived as "too direct" and what emotions that feedback brings up for you.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*
