 

Hello, Alex. Welcome to your interview for the Senior Project Manager position at Innovate Inc.

My name is Elara, and I'll be guiding you through a work-life simulation designed to understand your approach to various professional situations. This is a practical assessment of the emotional intelligence competencies required for this role.

The simulation consists of 10 scenarios. In each, you'll interact with colleagues, manage challenges, and make decisions just as you would on the job. There are no right or wrong answers, only your authentic responses. Your performance in one scenario may influence events in later ones.

Let's begin.

**Scenario 1 of 10: The Unexpected Feedback**

It's Monday morning. You've been in your role for a few months and are settling in. You sit down at your desk, ready to start the week. Your direct team lead, Michael, has just sent you a calendar invitation for a "Quick Sync" in 15 minutes with no other context. Before you can think too much about it, you see an email notification pop up. It's from Michael as well, with the subject line "Project Phoenix - Weekend Thoughts."

You open the email. In it, Michael praises the team's effort on Project Phoenix but includes a line that catches you off guard: "While the project is on track, I've noticed a tendency for your communication to be a bit too direct in team meetings, which may be affecting team morale. Let's discuss this and other things in our sync."

You have a few minutes before the meeting. What is your immediate focus?

1.  Open the Project Phoenix files and review your recent communications to find examples of what Michael might be referring to.
2.  Dismiss the comment for now. He said the project is on track, which is the main thing. Use the time to prepare your own agenda for the "Quick Sync."
3.  Feel a surge of defensiveness and immediately start drafting a reply to his email to justify your communication style before the meeting.
4.  Take a few deep breaths and reflect on your recent meetings. Try to honestly assess if your communication could be perceived as "too direct" and what emotions that feedback brings up for you.

You take a few moments to center yourself. The initial sting of criticism fades as you consciously decide to approach this with curiosity rather than defensiveness. You acknowledge the feeling of anxiety but don't let it dictate your reaction. You mentally scroll through recent team meetings, trying to see your contributions from an observer's perspective.

A few minutes later, you log into the video call. Michael is already there, a neutral expression on his face.

"Thanks for joining, Alex," he begins, offering a small smile. "As I said in the email, the team is doing great work on Project Phoenix, and your leadership is a big part of that. The reason I wanted to chat was about the point I mentioned regarding communication style. I want this to be a conversation. From your perspective, how do you feel the team discussions have been going?"

1.  "Honestly, Michael, I think they've been productive. We're getting things done efficiently, and I believe my direct approach helps keep us on track and avoids ambiguity."
2.  "I haven't really noticed any issues. Maybe one or two people are a bit sensitive, but the core team seems fine with it. Has someone specific complained?"
3.  "Thanks for bringing this to me directly. I appreciate the feedback. After your email, I did some thinking. Could you share a specific instance where my directness came across negatively? It would help me understand the impact I'm having."
4.  "I'm so sorry. I had no idea I was doing that. I'll be much more careful in the future, I promise."

Michael nods, a sense of relief and appreciation washing over his expression. "I'm really glad you asked, Alex. That's the best way to approach this, and I appreciate your openness.

A good example would be in yesterday's sync meeting. We were discussing the timeline for the new feature rollout, and Sarah from Design brought up a potential bottleneck with the user testing phase. You immediately responded with, 'That's not a real blocker, we just need to push through it.' Now, I know your intention was likely to keep the meeting efficient and show confidence, but the impact was that it effectively shut down that thread of conversation. Sarah didn't say anything for the rest of the meeting.

It's less about the specific issue and more about creating a dynamic where people feel safe to raise potential concerns, even if they turn out not to be major roadblocks. Does that example help clarify what I mean?"

1.  "I remember that now. In my head, I was being decisive, but hearing it back, I can see how it would come across as dismissive to Sarah. That wasn't my intention. Thank you, that's a very helpful example."
2.  "Okay, but in my defense, Sarah's concern *wasn't* a real blocker. We would have gotten bogged down in a 20-minute debate over nothing if I hadn't stepped in to keep us on track."
3.  "So this is really about Sarah? I can try to be more careful around her, but it's hard to manage everyone's individual sensitivities."
4.  "You're right. I should go and apologize to Sarah immediately. Is she free right now?"

Michael visibly relaxes, a genuine smile appearing on his face. "That's exactly it, Alex. Thank you for hearing me out. I knew you'd get it.

Your drive and decisiveness are huge assets to this team, and I absolutely don't want to change that. It's just about fine-tuning the delivery so that you bring everyone along with you on the journey. It sounds like you understand that completely.

Perhaps just find a moment to check in with Sarah later today. Not to make a big formal apology, but just to reinforce that you value her input. How does that sound as a next step?"

1.  "That sounds like a great plan. I'll make sure to connect with her after our next stand-up. Thanks again for this, Michael. It was genuinely helpful."
2.  "Understood. I'll go find her right now and clear the air."
3.  "Okay, I'll talk to her. Was there anything else on your list?"
4.  "I'm still not sure it's necessary to bring it up again, it might make it more awkward. But I'll keep it in mind."

Michael nods, looking genuinely pleased. "Excellent. I have full confidence in you, Alex. Thanks for being so receptive." He gives you a supportive smile as he concludes the meeting.

--- Scenario 1 of 10 Complete. Let's continue. ---

A few days later, you're standing in the main conference room. The air is thick with anticipation. All the key stakeholders are here for your big "Project Nightingale" update, including the Division VP. Michael catches your eye and gives you a subtle, encouraging nod.

You take a deep breath, click the remote to start your presentation, and... nothing.

A blue screen flashes on the projector. An error message appears: `File Corrupted. Unable to open presentation.` You try again. Same result. A low murmur ripples through the room. The VP glances at their watch. Your heart starts to pound. Michael looks over at you, his expression a mixture of concern and expectation.

What do you do?

1.  Let out a frustrated sigh. "Of course this happens now. Unbelievable. Give me a minute, the file seems to be corrupted."
2.  Turn to Michael and whisper, "My backup isn't loading either. What should I do?"
3.  Address the room with a calm smile. "It seems the ghost in the machine has chosen an exciting moment to say hello! Please give me just 60 seconds to pull up the cloud backup. If that fails, I know this material well enough to proceed without the slides."
4.  Immediately open your laptop and start frantically searching for different file versions, ignoring the waiting executives.
