Hello, Jessica Chen. Welcome to the Emotional Intelligence assessment for the AI Research Scientist position at Synapse Robotics.

This simulation is designed to understand your approach to complex workplace situations. You will navigate through 10 distinct scenarios, interacting with various colleagues and challenges within a hyper-realistic work environment. Your choices will shape the narrative and the outcomes. There are no right or wrong answers, only opportunities to demonstrate your unique approach.

Let's begin.

You are an AI Research Scientist at Synapse Robotics, a key contributor to "Project Nemesis," a flagship initiative with a tight deadline. It's Tuesday morning, and you've just settled at your desk with your coffee. You open your inbox and see a new, high-priority email from Dr. Anya Sharma, the brilliant but notoriously demanding project lead.

**To:** Jessica Chen
**From:** Dr. Anya Sharma
**Subject:** URGENT: Nemesis Module Performance

Jessica,

I've reviewed the preliminary results from your latest model iteration. The performance metrics are significantly below the required baseline for this stage. This is a considerable setback. We are losing time. I need a full diagnostic report and a viable correction plan on my desk by 3 PM today. No excuses.

Dr. Sharma

You feel a knot form in your stomach as you read the email. This feedback feels abrupt and harsh, especially since you thought your last iteration showed promising initial trends.

What is your first, most immediate internal reaction?

1.  "This is so unfair. She didn't even acknowledge the progress I made or the long hours I put in."
2.  "I need to prove her wrong. I'll drop everything, run every diagnostic, and show her the data doesn't tell the whole story."
3.  "I can't believe I've failed. She must think I'm incompetent. This is a disaster."
4.  "Okay, that stings. I feel a mix of frustration and anxiety. Let me take a deep breath before I decide what to do."

Alex looks up from his screen, a bit surprised by your calm and direct approach. The frustration on his face softens. He runs a hand through his hair and lets out a long breath.

"Yeah... you're right. Sorry," he says, his voice much quieter now. "I got a bit carried away. Coffee in 15 sounds good. Thanks."

The tense atmosphere around your desks immediately dissipates. You've successfully navigated a difficult moment, preventing a larger conflict and strengthening your rapport with a key team member.

Later that afternoon, another team member, Maria, approaches your desk. She looks visibly distressed and is hesitant to make eye contact.

"Hey," she begins quietly. "Got a minute? I... I'm really sorry about my numbers this week. I know they're down. It's just... I'm going through some really difficult personal stuff at home, and it's making it almost impossible to focus. I feel like I'm letting the whole team down."

What do you do?

1.  "Don't even think about the numbers. Your well-being is the most important thing. Take all the time you need."
2.  "I'm sorry to hear that, but we do have deadlines to consider. Is there a specific, work-related adjustment we can make that will help you get your numbers back up?"
3.  "Thank you for telling me. I'm really sorry you're going through that. Let's find a quiet place to talk. We can figure out a plan together to adjust your workload for a bit, so you can manage what's on your plate without adding more stress."
4.  "That sounds tough. You should probably talk to HR. They have official resources and procedures for handling personal issues."

Maria looks visibly relieved. A small, grateful smile appears on her face.

"Thank you," she says, her voice thick with emotion. "That... that means a lot. Let's go to that small conference room."

By offering both empathy and a concrete, collaborative solution, you've helped a team member feel supported and secure during a difficult time, building significant trust.

--- Scenario 2 of 10 Complete. Let's continue. ---

The next morning, you're catching up on emails when a high-priority message from a senior director, Ms. Evans, hits your inbox. The subject line is stark: "URGENT: Strategic Pivot on Project Titan."

You've been leading Project Titan for three months, and your team is just weeks away from a major milestone. You open the email. It reads:

"Effective immediately, we are halting development on the current trajectory of Project Titan. Market analysis from the C-suite demands a significant pivot. The new focus will be on integrating AI-driven analytics, a feature set that was previously out of scope. I have attached the new preliminary brief. I need a revised project plan, budget, and timeline on my desk by EOD Friday. I understand this is a major shift, but it's critical to our Q4 objectives. Let's connect on this."

What is your immediate next step?

1.  Immediately call the team into a room, forward them the email, and express your own frustration with the sudden change from leadership.
2.  Reply directly to Ms. Evans, questioning the decision and pointing out how much work will be wasted and the negative impact this will have on team morale.
3.  Begin working on the revised plan by yourself. It's better to present a nearly-finished draft to the team to avoid causing them unnecessary panic or stress.
4.  Take an hour to carefully read the new brief and calm your own initial reactions. Then, schedule a meeting with the team to transparently discuss the change and brainstorm a path forward together.
