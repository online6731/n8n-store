Hello, Jessica Chen. Welcome to the Emotional Intelligence assessment for the AI Research Scientist position at Synapse Robotics.

This simulation is designed to understand your approach to complex workplace situations. You will navigate through 10 distinct scenarios, interacting with various colleagues and challenges within a hyper-realistic work environment. Your choices will shape the narrative and the outcomes. There are no right or wrong answers, only opportunities to demonstrate your unique approach.

Let's begin.

You are an AI Research Scientist at Synapse Robotics, a key contributor to "Project Nemesis," a flagship initiative with a tight deadline. It's Tuesday morning, and you've just settled at your desk with your coffee. You open your inbox and see a new, high-priority email from Dr. Anya Sharma, the brilliant but notoriously demanding project lead.

**To:** Jessica Chen
**From:** Dr. Anya Sharma
**Subject:** URGENT: Nemesis Module Performance

Jessica,

I've reviewed the preliminary results from your latest model iteration. The performance metrics are significantly below the required baseline for this stage. This is a considerable setback. We are losing time. I need a full diagnostic report and a viable correction plan on my desk by 3 PM today. No excuses.

Dr. Sharma

You feel a knot form in your stomach as you read the email. This feedback feels abrupt and harsh, especially since you thought your last iteration showed promising initial trends.

What is your first, most immediate internal reaction?

1.  "This is so unfair. She didn't even acknowledge the progress I made or the long hours I put in."
2.  "I need to prove her wrong. I'll drop everything, run every diagnostic, and show her the data doesn't tell the whole story."
3.  "I can't believe I've failed. She must think I'm incompetent. This is a disaster."
4.  "Okay, that stings. I feel a mix of frustration and anxiety. Let me take a deep breath before I decide what to do."
