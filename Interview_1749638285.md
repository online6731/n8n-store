 

Welcome, and thank you for participating in this assessment. My name is Elara, and I will be your guide through this simulation.

Over the next hour, we will navigate through 10 distinct scenarios designed to provide a comprehensive look at your professional approach in a dynamic work environment. You will be playing the role of Alex, a Project Manager at a company called Innovate Inc.

There are no right or wrong answers. My goal is to understand your natural decision-making process. I will present a situation, and you will respond. The narrative will adapt based on your choices.

Let's begin.

***

**Scenario 1 of 10**

You are Alex, a Project Manager at Innovate Inc. It's Monday morning. You've just sat down at your desk, coffee in hand, ready to plan your week. You open your inbox and see a new email from your direct manager, David, with the subject line "URGENT: Project Phoenix Timeline".

Project Phoenix is your highest-priority project. You open it. The email reads:

"Alex,

We've just lost a key vendor for Project Phoenix. Their sudden bankruptcy means we've lost access to a critical component. The launch date is in three weeks. This is a major blow. I need a full impact assessment and a preliminary recovery plan on my desk by noon.

Let me know your immediate first step.

-David"

What do you do?

1.  Immediately start mapping out the project dependencies and supply chain to understand the full technical impact.
2.  Take a moment to process. You acknowledge the jolt of panic, take a few deep breaths, and jot down the key deliverables David has asked for: "Impact Assessment" and "Recovery Plan" by noon.
3.  Reply to David immediately, acknowledging the email and assuring him you're on it and will have a plan by noon.
4.  Get up and walk over to find Sarah, your lead engineer on the project, to get her immediate, unfiltered reaction.
