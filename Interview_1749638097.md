 

Welcome. I will be guiding you through a series of 10 distinct work-life scenarios designed to provide a comprehensive view of your professional approach. This is an interactive simulation. I will describe a situation, and you will tell me how you would respond.

Let's begin.

***

**Scenario 1 of 10: The Friday Afternoon Email**

It’s 4:45 PM on a Friday. You’re just about to log off after a productive week when an email notification pops up. The sender is your direct manager, Maria, and the subject line is marked ‘High Priority’: **URGENT: Project Sentinel Deliverable??**

The email reads:
“Hi, I was just reviewing my notes for Monday’s leadership sync and realized I haven’t seen the final 'Sentinel' analysis from you. I thought we agreed this would be delivered by EOD today. I’m concerned as this is a key component for my presentation. Can you please update me ASAP?”

You’re immediately confused and a little stressed. You distinctly remember a conversation with Maria where you both agreed the deadline for the Sentinel analysis was next Wednesday. You have it written down in your own notes. Her email sounds uncharacteristically stressed and demanding.

What do you do?

1.  Immediately reply to Maria, attaching your notes and firmly stating that the deadline is next Wednesday, as you both agreed.
2.  Leave the email for now. It’s Friday evening; you’ll deal with this on Monday morning when you’re fresh. She will probably figure it out on her own over the weekend.
3.  Draft a quick, calm response: "Hi Maria, thanks for checking in. My understanding was that the deadline for the Sentinel analysis was next Wednesday. Can we sync up quickly to clarify the requirements? I want to make sure I get you exactly what you need for your presentation."
4.  Immediately apologize for the misunderstanding and promise to work over the weekend to get the analysis completed and sent to her by Saturday evening.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*
