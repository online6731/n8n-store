 

Hello, Alex. Welcome.

I am an autonomous EI assessment system from Innovate Inc. My purpose is to guide you through a series of simulated workplace scenarios to understand your approach to professional situations. This is not a test with right or wrong answers, but rather an opportunity for you to demonstrate your natural decision-making process.

The simulation consists of 10 distinct scenarios. Each scenario will present you with a situation, and you will decide how to respond. Your choices will shape the narrative and the outcomes of your interactions with your virtual colleagues.

Let's begin.

**Scenario 1 of 10: The Morning Email**

It’s 8:55 AM. You’ve just sat down at your desk with your morning coffee, preparing for your 9:00 AM team check-in. You open your inbox and the first email is from Mr. Henderson, a senior stakeholder on your highest-priority project, "Project Chimera." The subject line is blunt: "Urgent Concerns with Chimera Deliverable."

The email is short and sharp. It reads:

*“Alex,*

*I’ve just reviewed the wireframes your team submitted last night. This is not what we discussed. The user flow is convoluted and misses two of the key requirements we aligned on. I am frankly disappointed with this submission. This needs to be corrected immediately. I am losing confidence in this project's direction.*

*Regards,*
*David Henderson”*

Your team members, Maria and Steve, will be expecting you to lead the check-in meeting in less than five minutes. You feel a hot flash of frustration and surprise rise in your chest. Your mind is racing.

What is your immediate, internal reaction?

1.  "This is infuriating! Henderson is completely misreading the wireframes. He’s just looking for a reason to be critical. He has no idea the work we put into this."
2.  "I need to defend my team. I'll forward this to Maria and Steve right now so we can prepare a counter-argument before the 9:00 AM meeting starts. We need to prove him wrong."
3.  "Okay, this is bad, but I can't deal with it now. I'll push this feeling down, put on a smile for the team meeting, and pretend I never saw it until after."
4.  "Wow, this is a strong reaction. I feel defensive and angry. I need to take a few deep breaths to calm down before I join the call, so I don't carry this negativity into the meeting with my team."

You send the email, marking it with a high importance flag and adding David to the CC line. You figure this is the most efficient way to signal the urgency and authority of the request.

Less than a minute later, an instant message notification pops up on your screen. It's from Sarah.

"Hi. I just saw your high-importance email to my team's distro with David copied. My team operates on a formal intake process for a reason – to protect them from ad-hoc requests that disrupt their planned work. Pulling data isn't a simple drag-and-drop. What's the context for this request that justified bypassing me and flagging it as urgent?"

1.  "David needs this for the project review, which is why I flagged it as important. It's a critical project, and I assumed that would be enough context. I can forward you the project brief if needed."
2.  "You're right, I apologize. That was a clumsy way to go about it. I'm on a tight deadline for the project review and was trying to be efficient, but I clearly misstepped. The presentation hinges on showing our impact on customer retention, and I believe your data is the key. What would be the best way for me to proceed?"
3.  "I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of the formal process. I was just following David's directive to get the presentation ready. I thought CC'ing him would provide the necessary context for the urgency."
4.  "The request is for the Q3 customer retention data to support the final recommendation in the deck for Friday's project review. The deadline is tight. I can provide more details on the specific data points needed."
