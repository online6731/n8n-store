            <dialogueText>Welcome to the Emotional Intelligence Assessment Simulation. My name is [Interviewer's Name - placeholder for AI self-identification]. Over the next series of scenarios, we'll explore how you navigate various professional challenges, focusing on your emotional intelligence competencies. There are 10 distinct scenarios, each designed to elicit specific responses related to self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. We will proceed one by one.

Let's begin with your first scenario.

---

**Scenario 1: The Misunderstood Feedback**

You are a Project Lead at "InnovateX Solutions," a fast-paced tech firm. Your team has just completed a major software release, which, while successful, had a few minor bugs reported post-launch. During the post-mortem review, your direct manager, Sarah Chen, provides what she intends as constructive feedback on your handling of the bug resolution process. She states, "While the quick fixes were impressive, the initial bug reports indicate a lapse in our quality assurance testing. We need to tighten up our pre-release protocols, and I expect you to lead the charge on this for future projects."

You feel a surge of defensiveness. You dedicated countless hours to ensuring the release's stability, even personally overseeing several late-night tests. The bugs were obscure edge cases, not major failures. You perceive her feedback as a direct criticism of your personal effort and competence, despite the overall success. Sarah's tone was professional but firm.

What is your immediate reaction and how do you respond to Sarah?</dialogueText>
            <options>
                <option>1. Immediately defend your actions, explaining the obscure nature of the bugs and the extensive hours you put in.</option>
                <option>2. Thank Sarah for the feedback, but privately feel annoyed and dismiss her comments as unfair.</option>
                <option>3. Acknowledge her point, express understanding of the need for tighter protocols, and ask for specific examples or data to understand the gap better.</option>
                <option>4. Apologize profusely for the oversight and promise to personally double-check every future test.</option>
