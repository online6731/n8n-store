 

Hello. I will be your guide for this assessment.

This is a dynamic simulation designed to understand your approach to various workplace situations. Over the next 10 scenarios, you will be placed in the role of a Senior Project Manager at a tech company called Innovate Inc. Your choices and responses will shape the narrative. There are no right or wrong answers, only opportunities to demonstrate your professional judgment.

Let's begin.

***

It's Monday morning at 9:05 AM. You've just settled at your desk with your coffee, ready to plan your week. You've recently been assigned to "Project Chimera," a critical initiative for the company, but the previous project manager left abruptly, and the documentation is not well-organized.

As you open your inbox, you see an email marked with high importance, sent just minutes ago from Maria, the Chief Technology Officer.

**Subject: URGENT: Project Chimera Status for Board Meeting**

> All,
>
> I am heading into a board meeting at 10:00 AM sharp and need a concise status update on Project Chimera to present. I'm seeing some concerning data on the preliminary budget burn rate.
>
> I need to know our current timeline projection, budget status, and a list of the top 3 critical risks. Now.
>
> Maria Flores
>
> CTO, Innovate Inc.

You know you don't have this information readily available. Your technical lead, Liam, who might have some answers, doesn't start his day until 9:30 AM. You have less than an hour. You feel a jolt of pressure.

What is your immediate next step?

1.  Immediately reply to Maria, letting her know you've seen the email and will get her the information as soon as possible.
2.  Start digging through the disorganized project files yourself, trying to piece together the budget and timeline from scratch.
3.  Forward the email to the entire Project Chimera team distribution list with the message, "Team, all hands on deck! Need this info for the CTO ASAP!"
4.  Take a moment to draft a calm, structured response to Maria, acknowledging the request, stating what you *can* confirm now, and outlining a clear, realistic plan for getting her the remaining details before 10:00 AM.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*

You take a deep breath, pushing aside the initial panic, and quickly draft a reply. You acknowledge her request, confirm you're the new PM for Chimera, and explain that while you're still getting up to speed, you will mobilize the necessary resources and provide the best possible data before her 10:00 AM meeting. You hit send at 9:15 AM.

A few minutes later, your inbox pings. It's a reply from Maria.

**Subject: RE: URGENT: Project Chimera Status for Board Meeting**

> Thanks for the prompt and professional response. Understood. I appreciate you taking charge of this. Get me what you can by 9:55 AM. The more concrete, the better.

It's now 9:20 AM. Your technical lead, Liam, is your best source of information. His calendar shows he's 'Available' starting at 9:30 AM. You need to get him up to speed quickly and effectively without causing undue panic.

What do you do?

1.  Send him a calendar invite for exactly 9:30 AM titled "URGENT: Chimera Status for CTO."
2.  Send him a brief instant message: "Hey Liam, quick heads up for when you log on. We have an urgent request from Maria for a Project Chimera update. Need your help to pull some data before 10 AM. Let me know when you're ready."
3.  Wait until you see his status turn green on the chat app at exactly 9:30 AM, then call him immediately without any warning.
4.  Forward Maria's entire email chain to him with the message, "See below. We need this NOW."
