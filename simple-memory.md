Subject: Urgent - Project Horizon Data

"Hi Alex,

Hope you're settling in. I need a critical piece of data for Project Horizon *before* our 10 AM sync. It's the Q3 client engagement metrics, specifically the conversion rates from the initial pilot phase. Mark usually handles this, but he's out today. You should be able to find it in the 'Project Horizon/Analytics/Q3 Data' folder on the shared drive. It might be buried in an Excel spreadsheet.

Please get this to me ASAP once you've pulled it. We need it for the discussion points.

Thanks,
Sarah"

**It's 8:55 AM.** The clock is ticking towards the 10:00 AM meeting, and this data is clearly a priority.

What's your next step?

1.  Head straight to the shared drive to locate the data.
2.  Quickly check your own files first, just in case you have a copy.
3.  Send a quick reply to Sarah confirming you're on it, then search.
4.  Ask a colleague if they know where Mark usually keeps such specific data.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
