The Director presents a new simulation:

The gentle hum of office life begins to stir around you. Sunlight, filtered through the blinds, stripes your modern, ergonomic desk at Innovate Solutions. You're Alex, an Associate Consultant, and the air already carries the faint scent of brewing coffee and ambitious deadlines. It's **8:30 AM**, and the office is slowly coming to life.

Across the aisle, Sarah, your Senior Consultant and project lead for the 'Everest' client, is already at her desk, engrossed in her laptop but occasionally glancing up. The murmur of early morning chatter fills the open-plan space. Your to-do list, a mental note for the day, starts with a team check-in at 9:00 AM, followed by a data analysis sprint.

What's the first thing you do as the workday officially begins?

1.  Head straight to the communal kitchen for coffee to kickstart the day.
2.  Log into your computer and begin reviewing your emails and today's calendar.
3.  Walk over to Sarah's desk to greet her and casually ask about the day's priorities.
4.  Organize your desk and review physical notes to mentally prepare for the morning.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
