**The Director:** You've acutely observed the core of the dilemma, Alex. The initial moments of a workday, especially at Innovate Solutions, are often a balance of urgency, preparation, and proactive engagement.

You're at the precipice of your first decision. It's **8:52 AM**, and Leo's urgent email still glows on your screen.

What is your definitive choice for your first action of the day?

1.  **Dive straight into Leo's email.** It's marked urgent, and Project Aether is a big deal.
2.  **Check other emails first.** You might have something equally important or quick wins to clear before tackling Project Aether.
3.  **Grab a coffee from the breakroom.** You can review emails with a fresh cup in hand.
4.  **Quickly review yesterday's notes for Project Aether.** Refresh your memory before engaging with new updates.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action. Your decision will now dictate the next sequence of events.
