**The Director:** A prudent move, Alex. Just as you were about to hit 'Save' on your draft, at **10:25 AM**, you switch tabs back to your inbox, anticipation bubbling slightly.

You see a new email from Leo Maxwell, timestamped **10:20 AM**, with the subject: "Re: Urgent: Project Aether Kick-off Prep - Action Required (my update)."

You open it immediately.

*From: Leo Maxwell (Senior Manager)*
*To: Alex Chen*
*Date: Today, 10:20 AM*

*Hi Alex,*

*Thanks for getting on this so quickly. Good question about the update. Quantum Innovations just signed a major partnership with a leading AI research institute – 'Cognitive Apex'. This accelerates their internal timeline for AI integration projects significantly, and they want Project Aether to be their foundational step in building the necessary data infrastructure.*

*So, the "critical update" isn't a problem, it's an opportunity – they're even more committed and want to move faster. Our brief needs to emphasize our ability to deliver a robust, scalable data foundation that can immediately support advanced AI initiatives.*

*I'm free now. Come grab me when you're ready to quickly chat through your draft and these new details. I've got about 15 minutes before my next commitment.*

*Best,*
*Leo*

This is it. The missing piece of the puzzle. The new partnership with "Cognitive Apex" and the direct link to AI integration completely shifts the emphasis. You've got about 15 minutes with Leo, and you've already made significant progress on the draft.

It's now **10:28 AM**.

What's your next immediate action?

1.  **Head straight to Leo's desk with your draft.** Go over it with him now that you have the full picture.
2.  **Quickly integrate the new information into your draft.** Make the necessary edits before showing it to Leo.
3.  **Outline key questions for Leo.** Prepare specific questions about the Cognitive Apex partnership and how it impacts the brief.
4.  **Send a quick chat message to Leo.** Confirm you've seen his email and are on your way, asking if he prefers you bring your laptop or just key points.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
