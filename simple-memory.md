As a professional, my priority is always to address the most pressing matters first, especially when they come from a Project Lead and are marked 'Urgent'. Client needs, particularly in an engagement like 'Quantum Leap', often have a direct impact on our success and reputation. Understanding the nature of the urgency allows me to quickly assess the situation and determine the best course of action, even before the official workday begins. I'd rather be informed and proactive than caught off guard. After addressing Liam's email, I would then take a moment to review my calendar and structure my day effectively.

**(The Director's Voice - Preamble)**
Welcome, Alex. The stage is set. You are now stepping into the meticulously crafted world of Innovate Solutions, a leading consulting firm where innovation meets execution. Your journey as a Junior Consultant begins today. Every interaction, every decision, every nuance will shape your path. I am The Director, and I'm here to ensure your experience is as dynamic and real as possible. Let the simulation commence.

**(Narrator Persona)**
The subtle hum of air conditioning and the distant murmur of voices are the first things you register as you step off the elevator on the 12th floor of the sleek Innovate Solutions building. It’s **8:30 AM** on your first official day. Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating a modern, open-plan office space buzzing with quiet activity. Consultants in crisp business casual move with purpose, some already at their standing desks, others gathered around communal coffee machines.

You clutch your new employee welcome packet, a mix of anticipation and nerves swirling within you. Your badge, shiny and new, feels oddly heavy around your neck. You’re early, but the office feels alive. You spot a small, designated 'New Hire' desk near the reception area, marked with a discreet sign. It seems like the first logical step.

What do you do?

1.  Head straight to the New Hire desk and check in.
2.  Find the coffee machine first; you definitely need a jolt.
3.  Take a moment to observe the office layout and people-watch before doing anything.
4.  Look for any familiar faces or try to spot your team's section.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
