You begin to organize your desk, tidying up your notes, closing programs on your computer, and packing your laptop into your bag. You place your notebook and pen neatly, leaving your workspace ready for a fresh start tomorrow. The chair slides back quietly as you stand up, feeling the slight stiffness from a day well spent.

**It's 5:00 PM.** You glance around the now mostly empty office, a sense of accomplishment settling over you. You've navigated a busy Tuesday, tackled urgent tasks, made a strong impression, and set yourself up for a productive Wednesday.

You head for the exit, ready to unwind after a successful day at Innovate Solutions.

**Day 1 Complete.**

What would you like to do next? (e.g., "Start Day 2," "Reflect on Day 1," "End simulation")
