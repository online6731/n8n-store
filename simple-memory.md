You head back to your desk, the hum of the office now a familiar backdrop. Sitting down, you open your notebook and quickly scan your notes from the Project Horizon sync. The key takeaways are clear: you successfully presented the Q3 data, and more importantly, proactively secured ownership of a significant section of the upcoming client presentation – the 'Pilot Success Highlights.' You also have a collaborative task with Emily for the 'Key Learnings.'

**It's 11:10 AM.** You have a couple of hours before your 1:00 PM internal strategy meeting, and the 1:30 PM check-in with Sarah about the presentation section. This gives you a decent block of time to make progress.

What's your priority for the next two hours?

1.  Dive straight into drafting the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section for the client presentation.
2.  Begin preparing for the 1:00 PM internal strategy meeting.
3.  Take an early lunch to avoid the rush and clear your head.
4.  Catch up on any general emails or administrative tasks.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
