You decide that context is key. Before diving into the raw Q3 data, understanding the preceding quarter's performance will provide invaluable insights.

You open the 'Project Phoenix - Q2 Sales Projections' report. You quickly scan the executive summary, noting the key growth areas, any unexpected dips, and the overall trends identified in the previous quarter. You pay particular attention to the commentary on market conditions or specific client initiatives that impacted Q2. This brief review helps to frame your expectations for Q3, providing a benchmark against which to measure the new data. You're not just looking at numbers; you're looking at them in relation to the past, ready to spot continuation or deviation.

As you close the Q2 report, the digital clock on your monitor shows **9:50 AM**. You feel well-prepared, with both your digital files organized and historical context fresh in your mind. The hum of the office has settled into a productive rhythm.

2.  **Take a quick stretch break:** Prepare physically for focused work.
3.  **Mentally outline your analysis plan:** Structure your approach to the Q3 data.
