**The Director:** You've precisely articulated the critical path, Alex. Proceeding without understanding the "critical update" would indeed be a significant oversight, risking a misaligned brief and agenda for a high-visibility project. Your instinct for precision and accuracy is a strong asset.

It's **9:28 AM**, and every minute counts towards that 1:00 PM deadline. The need for this specific update is paramount.

Now, translating your sound reasoning into immediate action, what is your definitive choice for obtaining this crucial information?

1.  **Start drafting immediately.** You have enough context now to begin outlining the brief and agenda.
2.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** She worked on the initial proposal for Project Aether and might have up-to-date or detailed insights, potentially even details about the "critical update."
3.  **Conduct a quick online search for Quantum Innovations.** Learn more about their recent news, industry position, and any public statements about their digital strategy that might explain the acceleration.
4.  **Draft a quick email to Leo Maxwell.** Ask if there's any specific "critical update" beyond the accelerated timeline that he mentioned in his email, as the existing files don't reflect that.

You **must** select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own specific course of action. Your immediate decision is required to advance the simulation.
