You confidently begin to present the Q3 client engagement metrics. "Based on the data from the 'Conversion Summary' tab in the Project Horizon Q3 Analytics, the overall conversion rate for the initial pilot phase stood at an average of **12.5%**," you state clearly. "We observed a strong initial uptake in the first month, reaching **15%**, which then leveled off slightly to **11%** by the end of Q3. The data suggests that while initial engagement is promising, there might be opportunities to sustain that momentum post-onboarding."

Sarah nods approvingly. "Excellent, Alex, that's exactly what we needed to see. It aligns with some of the qualitative feedback we've been getting." David chimes in, "Good work, Alex. That 12.5% benchmark gives us a solid baseline."

The discussion then shifts to the next agenda item. David takes the lead: "Okay, moving on to the 'Update on Pilot Phase Feedback Collection.' Emily, can you walk us through where we are with synthesizing the user feedback?" Emily begins to detail the progress on compiling survey responses and interview notes.

**It's 10:25 AM.** The meeting is in full swing, and you've made a positive initial contribution.

What's your next move during the meeting?

1.  Listen attentively to Emily's update, ready to contribute if needed.
2.  Review your notes from the previous discussion point, adding any missed details.
3.  Jot down potential questions to ask Emily about the feedback collection.
4.  Mentally shift focus to the 'Next Steps for Client Presentation' item on the agenda.
