"Yes, that helps," you reply, meeting David's gaze. "Considering both internal analysis and the need for a strong client presentation, I'd lean towards Tableau. It's excellent for creating interactive client-facing dashboards, allows for deep dives, and we already have licenses, which simplifies integration and sharing."

David nods slowly, a slight smile forming. "Good. That's a solid recommendation, Alex. Familiarity with the tool will definitely speed things up. Excellent. Now, moving on..."

The stand-up continues, with David wrapping up the meeting shortly after. As colleagues begin to disperse, the digital clock on your monitor back at your desk shows **9:15 AM**. You've successfully navigated the first hurdle of the day, delivering a concise update and a well-reasoned suggestion. The immediate pressure of the stand-up has lifted.

Your next scheduled task is "Data Analysis for 'Phoenix' (Q3 Sales Projections)" at 10:00 AM, with initial findings due to David by 11:30 AM.

What will you do with this brief window of time before diving into the core data analysis?

1.  **Start the data analysis early:** Get a head start on the Q3 sales projections.
2.  **Grab a coffee:** Now's a good time for that much-needed caffeine boost.
3.  **Quickly check your personal messages:** A small break to touch base before deep work.
4.  **Organize your digital files:** Create a specific folder for Project Phoenix Q3 analysis to keep everything tidy.
