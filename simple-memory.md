You quickly minimize your email and open the 'Project Phoenix - Data Cleansing Log' file from yesterday. A spreadsheet pops up, filled with rows of cleaned and validated sales figures, along with notes on discrepancies resolved and outliers handled. You mentally review the process, recalling the specific steps taken to ensure accuracy and consistency. It feels good to have a clear understanding of the groundwork laid.

Just as you finish your quick review, the digital clock on your monitor clicks over to **9:00 AM**.

**(The Director's Voice)**

The initial quiet moments have passed, and the work day is truly underway. With your notes refreshed, it's time to transition to your first official meeting.

**(The Simulation Continues)**

You close your laptop and make your way to Conference Room B. Inside, David Chen is already standing at the head of the table, a tablet in hand. Maria and Ben, your fellow team members on Project Phoenix, are taking their seats. The room is modern and minimalist, with a large screen dominating one wall.

"Alright team, let's kick this off," David says, his voice clear and energetic. "Good morning. Let's do our quick 3-2-1 updates for Project Phoenix. Maria, why don't we start with you today?"

Maria provides her updates on the client communication strategy. Ben follows, outlining the initial framework for the client feedback survey. Finally, David turns to you.

"Alex, you're up. Can you give us an update on the data cleansing progress and your thoughts on the best visualization tool for the Q3 projections?"

What will you say?

1.  **Summarize cleansing progress concisely:** "Yesterday, I completed the initial data cleansing, ensuring all Q3 sales figures are accurate and consistent. No major anomalies found."
2.  **Suggest a specific visualization tool:** "I recommend using Tableau for the Q3 projections due to its interactive dashboards and ease of sharing with the client."
3.  **Ask a clarifying question:** "David, when you say 'best visualization tool,' are we aiming for internal analysis or client presentation?"
4.  **Offer a general update:** "Data cleansing went well, and I'm still evaluating options for the visualization tool."
