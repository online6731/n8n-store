You've already taken that crucial step, Alex! Your previous action was to **analyze the 'Synergy Streamline' decline**, and you successfully uncovered that "Apex Innovations" scaling back their scope was the primary cause for the -2.6% dip. This provided vital clarity on the "why" behind the decline.

It's now **10:45 AM**. The 10 AM internal review with Sarah Chen and the client team for Project Phoenix is either already underway or about to begin, and you're armed with this critical finding regarding Synergy Streamline, along with your earlier analysis of Project Phoenix's unique growth factors.

Given the urgency of the review and your latest findings, what's your next strategic move?

1.  **Draft a concise email to Liam:** Immediately inform him about the Apex Innovations finding and how it explains the Synergy Streamline dip.
2.  **Rush to the internal review:** Head straight to the meeting room to provide an in-person update, even if you're a bit late.
3.  **Prepare a brief slide:** Quickly summarize the Apex Innovations finding and its impact on Synergy Streamline for the review.
4.  **Focus on the overall Q3 report:** Integrate the Apex Innovations finding into the broader Q3 report narrative, ready for the client meeting.
