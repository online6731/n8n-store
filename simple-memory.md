**(The Director's Voice)**

Understood, Alex. That nuanced internal narrative – the ambitious drive, the high stakes, the rejection of procrastination – paints a vivid picture of who you are. It's precisely this depth that will shape your journey today.

However, The Director needs a specific input to move the simulation forward. While your internal monologue is valuable, the world of Innovate Solutions awaits a decisive *action* from you.

What will Alex *do* as the very first step this Monday morning, at 7:00 AM?

1.  **Hit the snooze button one more time.** A few extra minutes of sleep will surely make a difference, you think.
2.  **Immediately check your phone for work updates.** The presentation is today; you can't afford to miss anything.
3.  **Head straight to the kitchen to brew some strong coffee.** You'll need the caffeine to tackle the day ahead.
4.  **Jump in the shower immediately to wake yourself up fully.** A quick, refreshing start is key.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
