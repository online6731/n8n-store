You discreetly pull out your phone or open your internal chat client, quickly typing a message to Sarah Chen: "Hi Sarah, just wrapping up the internal strategy meeting now. I'll be heading over to your office/our meeting spot immediately and should be there in just a few minutes, apologies for any slight delay. Looking forward to discussing the presentation."

You send the message, then subtly pack up your notes while continuing to listen to the ongoing discussion. Robert Peterson, the senior partner, begins to wrap up the Internal Strategy Meeting. "Alright team, great discussion today. Let's take these ideas forward and schedule a follow-up for next month. Thanks everyone."

**It's 1:31 PM.** The meeting disperses. You quickly gather your belongings and head towards Sarah Chen's office.

You arrive at Sarah's office door. She looks up from her computer, a slight smile on her face. "Alex, come on in. Thanks for the heads-up. Did you have a productive internal meeting?"

You step inside, taking a seat opposite her desk. "Yes, it was good. Discussed Q4 initiatives and resource allocation. But I'm ready to dive into the Project Horizon presentation." You open your laptop, pulling up the outline you started before lunch.

"Great," Sarah says, leaning forward. "So, you're taking the lead on the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section. Walk me through your initial thoughts and what you've drafted so far."

You explain your proposed structure, highlighting the Q3 conversion rate of 12.5% as a key metric, and how you plan to visualize it. You also share your idea of connecting this quantitative success with initial positive qualitative feedback from Emily's data.

Sarah listens intently, nodding occasionally. "I like it, Alex. Starting with a strong positive metric like that is key. And yes, weaving in the qualitative elements will make it much more robust." She offers a few specific suggestions for refining a chart you'd sketched out and advises on tone. "Just make sure we clearly articulate the 'so what' for the client – what does this success mean for them going forward?"

**It's 1:55 PM.** Your discussion with Sarah wraps up. You have clear direction and a solid plan for the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section.

What's your next move for the afternoon?

1.  Immediately begin implementing Sarah's feedback on the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section.
2.  Reach out to Emily White to coordinate on integrating the qualitative feedback into the presentation.
3.  Check your general inbox for any new emails that have accumulated.
4.  Take a short break before diving into the next task.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
