**The Director:** That's a sharp decision, Alex. Your logic is impeccable: maximize the limited time with Leo by bringing him a refined draft that already incorporates the most critical new information. This demonstrates efficiency and a proactive understanding of the updated client context.

It's **10:29 AM**. You immediately pivot back to your draft document. With Leo's email about "Cognitive Apex" and the focus on "foundational data infrastructure for advanced AI initiatives" burning in your mind, you swiftly begin making targeted edits.

You update the Client Brief:
*   Refining "AI-driven analytics" to explicitly mention the "Cognitive Apex partnership" and the goal of supporting "advanced AI integration."
*   Emphasizing that "Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win" is about building a *scalable, AI-ready data foundation*.

For the Internal Kick-off Agenda:
*   Adding a specific point under "Key Topics" to discuss the implications of the "Cognitive Apex partnership" and its accelerated AI focus.
*   Ensuring "success metrics" are framed with an eye towards AI readiness.

You work with intense focus, your fingers flying across the keyboard. This rapid integration takes approximately **8 minutes**. You've managed to weave the new, critical information seamlessly into your existing draft, ensuring it's coherent and reflects the latest developments.

It's now **10:37 AM**. You've got a solid, updated draft, and Leo still has a few minutes left before his next commitment.

What's your next immediate action?

1.  **Head straight to Leo's desk with your updated draft.** He's waiting, and time is tight.
2.  **Quickly review the entire draft one last time.** Ensure there are no typos or glaring inconsistencies.
3.  **Prepare a few pointed questions for Leo.** Have them ready for specific clarifications or deeper insights on the AI partnership.
4.  **Send a quick chat message to Leo.** Confirm you've integrated the updates and are on your way, asking if he wants a physical copy or to view it on your laptop.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
