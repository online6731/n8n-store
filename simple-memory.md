You open a blank document, or perhaps a physical notebook if that's your preference, and begin to jot down some thoughts for the sync. You make a note of the Q3 conversion rates you just pulled for Sarah, considering potential questions that might arise about them. You also make a mental or physical note of the other agenda items: pilot phase feedback, client presentation next steps, and action items. Having these points outlined helps solidify your readiness.

**It's 9:45 AM.** You've spent some valuable time getting your head in the game for the Project Horizon sync, which is now just 15 minutes away. The office is getting a bit livelier as more people arrive and prepare for their morning meetings.

What's your next move as the meeting approaches?

1.  Head to the meeting room early to get a good seat and set up.
2.  Do a final quick scan of your general inbox for anything urgent that might have come in.
3.  Grab a glass of water or coffee to take into the meeting.
4.  Review the Project Horizon client brief one last time to refresh your memory on overall objectives.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
