**The Director:** Excellent, Alex. Your logical and methodical approach to gathering context and leveraging internal expertise before diving into creation is a hallmark of effective consulting. That's a solid strategy for tackling this accelerated timeline.

It's **9:09 AM**, and you immediately open your firm's shared drive, navigating to the "Project Aether" folder. You find a few preliminary documents:

*   **"Quantum Innovations - Initial Proposal Brief (DRAFT)"**: Dated three weeks ago, this document outlines the high-level understanding of Quantum's needs and Innovate Solutions' proposed approach to digital transformation. It contains sections on "Client Challenges," "Proposed Solutions," and "Anticipated Business Impact." It's somewhat generic but provides a foundational overview.
*   **"Meeting Notes - Leo & Quantum (2 weeks ago)"**: A brief summary of a preliminary discussion, noting Quantum's interest in "streamlined data flows" and "AI-driven analytics" to improve their operational efficiency. It also mentions a key stakeholder, Dr. Aris Thorne, their Head of R&D.
*   **"Internal Brainstorm - Project Aether (Last Week)"**: Just a few bullet points from an informal chat, mentioning potential software solutions and a reminder to define the project's success metrics early.

You quickly scan these documents, pulling out key phrases and understanding the initial scope and objectives. This review takes about 15 minutes, bringing the time to **9:24 AM**. You now have a slightly clearer picture of Project Aether's foundations.

With this context in hand, what's your next move?

1.  **Start drafting immediately.** You have enough context now to begin outlining the client brief and internal agenda.
2.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** She might have more up-to-date or detailed insights beyond these preliminary documents.
3.  **Conduct a quick online search for Quantum Innovations.** Learn more about their recent news, industry position, and any public statements about their digital strategy.
4.  **Draft a quick email to Leo Maxwell.** Ask if there's any specific "critical update" beyond the accelerated timeline that he mentioned in his email, as the existing files don't reflect that.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
