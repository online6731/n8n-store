**The Director:** Excellent prioritization, Alex. Your decision to leverage the current momentum and new information to immediately tackle the core drafting task is a highly effective use of your time. It demonstrates a proactive mindset and a clear understanding of the immediate deliverable.

It's **9:38 AM**, and you open a new document, titling it "Project Aether: Client Brief & Internal Kick-off Agenda - DRAFT." With Sarah's insights about data silos, predictive analytics, Dr. Evelyn Reed, and the "Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win" fresh in your mind, you begin to structure the document.

You start with the Client Brief, aiming for conciseness as Leo requested. You outline:

*   **Project Objectives:** Moving beyond generic digital transformation to address "streamlined data flows," "AI-driven analytics," and explicitly mentioning "resolving data silos" to improve the innovation cycle.
*   **Proposed Scope (Initial Phase):** Focusing on a "Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win" to demonstrate early value.
*   **Expected Outcomes:** Improved operational efficiency, faster innovation cycles, and better data-driven decision-making.

Then you move to the Internal Kick-off Agenda, thinking about who needs to be there and what needs to be covered:

*   **Attendees:** Leo Maxwell (Senior Manager), Alex Chen (Consultant), and placeholder for potential technical leads or solution architects.
*   **Key Topics:**
    *   Review of accelerated timeline & client expectations.
    *   Deep dive into Quantum's current data challenges (referencing data silos).
    *   Discussion of "Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win" concept.
    *   Initial thoughts on success metrics.
    *   Identification of immediate next steps & resource allocation.
*   **Open Questions for Quantum:** You list specific questions about their current tech stack, key data sources, and internal stakeholder mapping.

You work with intense focus, synthesizing information and structuring your thoughts logically. The drafting is progressing well, incorporating both the original proposal's intent and Sarah's recent, more specific context.

As you refine a bullet point on "data governance," you glance at the clock. It's now **10:25 AM**. Leo's client call should be wrapping up soon, and your email to him about the "critical update" might be answered. You've made significant progress on the draft, but there's still room for refinement based on that crucial missing piece of information.

What's your next move as Leo's call approaches its end?

1.  **Continue refining the draft.** You're on a roll and want to get as much done as possible before interruption.
2.  **Check your inbox for a reply from Leo.** He might have already responded to your email.
3.  **Prepare a few pointed questions for Leo.** Have them ready for when he becomes available, specifically regarding the "critical update."
4.  **Take a short break.** Stretch, grab a water, and clear your head before potential discussion with Leo.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
