My immediate action regarding these questionable figures would be:

**2. Cross-reference the data immediately: Pause your current review and search the shared drive for the latest market research report to verify the figures on slides 17 and 22.**

Ensuring data integrity is paramount, especially for a client presentation that's happening tomorrow. If I have a strong suspicion about the numbers, it's my responsibility to verify them as quickly as possible. Waiting until 10:30 AM to discuss with Sarah might delay critical corrections. A quick search for the relevant report will either confirm my suspicions or allay them, allowing me to provide an accurate review or flag concrete discrepancies to Sarah.
