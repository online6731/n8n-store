You decide the most direct path is best. You open the shared drive, navigating through the 'Project Horizon' folder, then into 'Analytics,' and finally 'Q3 Data.' The folder contains a few spreadsheets, but one stands out: `Horizon_Pilot_Q3_Metrics_V3.xlsx`.

You open the Excel file. It's extensive, with multiple tabs and dense data. You quickly scan through the tabs, looking for anything related to "conversion rates" or "engagement metrics." After a moment of searching, you find a tab labeled 'Conversion Summary' with a clear table outlining the pilot phase conversion rates. You quickly extract the relevant figures.

**It's now 9:15 AM.** You have the data in hand.

What's your next move?

1.  Immediately email the data to Sarah Chen.
2.  Quickly review the data yourself to ensure it makes sense before sending.
3.  Prepare a brief summary of the data to accompany the raw figures for Sarah.
4.  Ping Sarah on internal chat to let her know you've found it and are sending.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
