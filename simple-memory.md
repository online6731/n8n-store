You immediately return to your desk and open the presentation file. Sarah's feedback is fresh in your mind, and you waste no time in incorporating her suggestions. You refine the data visualization you'd sketched, ensuring the 12.5% conversion rate is prominently displayed. You also adjust the narrative to more clearly articulate the "so what" for the client, focusing on the implications of the pilot's initial success. You also start thinking about how best to link this quantitative success to the qualitative feedback Emily is gathering.

You spend a productive chunk of the afternoon diligently working on this section, referring back to the Q3 data and considering various ways to present the information clearly and impactfully.

**It's now 4:15 PM.** The late afternoon light streams into the office. You've made substantial progress on the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section and feel confident about its current state. You've also mentally outlined how you'll collaborate with Emily. The office buzz has mellowed slightly, but people are still at their desks, wrapping up their day or pushing through evening tasks.

What's your next move as the workday draws to a close?

1.  Reach out to Emily White to coordinate on the 'Key Learnings' section for the presentation.
2.  Review your calendar for tomorrow and start planning your tasks.
3.  Do a final sweep of your inbox and respond to any non-urgent emails.
4.  Head home for the day, feeling satisfied with your progress.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
