You decide it's a good idea to set yourself up for success tomorrow. You open your calendar and look at Wednesday's schedule. You see:
*   **9:00 AM:** Follow-up meeting with Emily White regarding Project Horizon presentation 'Key Learnings'
*   **11:00 AM:** Weekly team check-in with Sarah Chen
*   **2:00 PM:** Client call prep for 'Project Alpha' (a new project)

You mentally arrange your morning, knowing that the first hour will be dedicated to collaboration with Emily on the presentation. You also make a note to familiarize yourself with 'Project Alpha' before the client call prep. This brief planning session helps you feel prepared for the day ahead.

**It's 4:50 PM.** You've effectively managed your day, tackling urgent tasks, making significant progress on a key presentation, and proactively setting yourself up for tomorrow. The office is now significantly quieter, with only a few dedicated colleagues still working.

What's your final action for the day?

1.  Do a final quick check of your inbox for any last-minute critical emails.
2.  Organize your desk and pack up your bag, ready to head home.
3.  Draft a quick summary of your Project Horizon progress for Sarah, to send tomorrow.
4.  Spend 10 minutes reading industry news or company updates.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
