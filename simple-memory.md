You immediately open a new presentation document or a fresh page in your notes. Recalling the Q3 conversion rates and the initial client feedback themes, you start brainstorming how to structure the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section. You envision presenting the 12.5% conversion rate as a key success metric, perhaps visually, and then backing it up with a brief narrative of initial positive engagement. You begin outlining bullet points and consider what charts or graphs would best represent the data effectively.

You spend a solid hour engrossed in this task, reviewing the raw Q3 data again and sketching out potential slides. You manage to draft a solid outline and even create a preliminary data visualization.

**It's now 12:15 PM.** You've made significant progress on the presentation section, feeling good about having a head start for your 1:30 PM meeting with Sarah. Your 1:00 PM internal strategy meeting is now less than an hour away.
