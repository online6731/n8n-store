Welcome, Alex. It's 7:00 AM.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and the quiet hum of early morning activity greet you as you step into the sleek, modern lobby of Innovate Solutions. The polished chrome and glass reflect the soft glow of the rising sun, and the company's minimalist logo glows subtly above the reception desk.

You're a new Associate Consultant, and today is your first full day on the job. Your calendar is already buzzing with entries. A quick glance at your watch confirms you're early, giving you a few moments to collect your thoughts before the day truly begins.

The reception area is calm, only a few early birds already at their desks through the glass partitions. Sarah, the usually cheerful and efficient front desk manager, is just settling in, her eyes scanning her own monitor.

What's your first move?

1.  Head straight to your assigned desk and start setting up your computer.
2.  Grab a coffee from the communal kitchen before anyone else arrives.
3.  Introduce yourself to Sarah and ask about the office layout.
4.  Review your digital calendar on your phone to mentally prepare for the day.
