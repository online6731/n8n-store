My immediate course of action would be:

**3. Quickly reply to Sarah: Acknowledge receipt of her email and confirm you're on it, then open the slides.**

This ensures Sarah knows I've received the urgent request and am on top of it, especially since she's on a call. Immediately after that brief confirmation, I would dive directly into reviewing the presentation slides, focusing on data integrity and visual clarity as requested. I'd briefly check my calendar for tomorrow's 9 AM slot as I open the slides to ensure there are no immediate conflicts that would hinder my ability to support, but the priority is to begin the review.
