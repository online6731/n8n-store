**The Director:** That's a highly intelligent and efficient use of this hour, Alex. Your decision to leverage Sarah's immediate insights before diving into drafting, especially with the uncertainty of Leo's "critical update," is a prime example of strategic resourcefulness.

It's **9:31 AM**. You immediately send a quick message to Sarah Jenkins via the internal chat system:

*To: Sarah Jenkins*
*Subject: Quick Q on Project Aether*

*Hi Sarah,*

*Hope you're having a good morning. Leo just sent an urgent email about Project Aether – accelerated timeline, internal kick-off this afternoon. I'm pulling together the initial client brief and internal agenda, and I saw your name on the original proposal.*

*Do you happen to have any more recent notes or insights on Quantum Innovations, especially anything that might shed light on recent developments or what might be driving this acceleration? Any key challenges or client priorities you remember from the early discussions that aren't in the standard docs?*

*No worries if you're swamped, just thought I'd check if you had anything handy.*

*Thanks, Alex*

A few minutes later, at **9:35 AM**, you receive a quick reply from Sarah:

*From: Sarah Jenkins*
*To: Alex Chen*

*Hi Alex,*

*Yep, just saw Leo's email. Busy morning here too, but happy to help! Quantum's a tricky one. From what I recall, their biggest pain point was always **data silos** across their R&D and manufacturing divisions, which was severely impacting their innovation cycle. They also mentioned wanting to integrate more **predictive analytics** for supply chain optimization.*

*The "critical update" might relate to a recent push from their new Head of Digital Transformation, Dr. Evelyn Reed – she's a real driver. Heard she might be looking for quick wins to demonstrate value early. We speculated about a **"Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win"** as a potential starting point for them.*

*Don't have docs beyond what's in the shared drive for now, but that's my two cents from the early days. Good luck with the brief!*

*Best, Sarah*

This new information from Sarah, particularly about data silos, predictive analytics, Dr. Evelyn Reed, and the "Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win," adds significant depth and a potential angle for the brief. It's now **9:38 AM**. You have about an hour before Leo is free, and a clearer picture of potential client needs and recent developments.

What's your next strategic move, armed with Sarah's insights?

1.  **Start drafting the client brief and internal agenda.** You have a much stronger foundation now.
2.  **Conduct a quick online search for Quantum Innovations.** Focus specifically on Dr. Evelyn Reed or any recent announcements about digital transformation to corroborate Sarah's insights.
3.  **Outline key questions for Leo Maxwell.** Prepare specific questions to ask him when he's free at 10:30 AM, ensuring you cover the "critical update" and Sarah's new points.
4.  **Take a short break to mentally organize.** Grab a coffee or stretch; your brain is now full of new information.
