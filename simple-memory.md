You decide it's a good time to touch base with Emily. You quickly send her an internal chat message: "Hi Emily, hope your afternoon's going well. Just wanted to quickly connect regarding the 'Key Learnings' section for the Project Horizon client presentation. I've made good progress on the 'Pilot Success Highlights,' and I'm ready to collaborate on integrating the qualitative feedback. Do you have a quick moment now, or perhaps we can align on a time tomorrow?"

A moment later, Emily replies: "Hey Alex! Good timing, I was just compiling some of the final feedback themes. Yes, a quick moment now would be great. Can you pop over to my desk, or should I come to yours?"

You walk over to Emily's desk. She has a complex spreadsheet open, filled with categorized feedback snippets. You briefly discuss the flow – how your quantitative success highlights can lead into her qualitative insights, and how they can mutually reinforce each other. You agree to share your draft of the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section with her, so she can see the context, and she'll send you her compiled themes. You decide that a deeper dive will be best done tomorrow morning.

**It's now 4:35 PM.** You've successfully coordinated with Emily and laid the groundwork for further collaboration. The office is noticeably quieter now, with some colleagues already packing up.

What's your next move for the remainder of the workday?

1.  Do a final sweep of your inbox and respond to any critical emails.
2.  Review your calendar for tomorrow and mentally prepare your tasks.
3.  Continue to refine the 'Pilot Success Highlights' section, leveraging the coordination with Emily.
4.  Organize your desk and prepare to head home for the day.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
