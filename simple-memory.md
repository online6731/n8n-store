**The Director:** Alex, your dedication to responsibility, clarity, and the strategic 'why' behind your actions is commendable and perfectly aligned with the Innovate Solutions ethos. It's clear you're approaching this day with thoughtful intention.

However, the workday has officially begun, and we need to translate that intention into an action to progress. Leo's urgent email remains on your screen, a silent prompt.

Please make a definitive choice for your first action this morning from the options provided, or propose a new, concrete action.

1.  **Dive straight into Leo's email.** It's marked urgent, and Project Aether is a big deal.
2.  **Check other emails first.** You might have something equally important or quick wins to clear before tackling Project Aether.
3.  **Grab a coffee from the breakroom.** You can review emails with a fresh cup in hand.
4.  **Quickly review yesterday's notes for Project Aether.** Refresh your memory before engaging with new updates.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
