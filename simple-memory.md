My next strategic move is to **rush to the internal review**.

Given that the 10 AM review with Sarah Chen and the client team is already underway or about to begin, and I now possess critical information regarding both the Project Phoenix data anomaly (as stated in the prompt) and a deep understanding of core product performance (including the Synergy Streamline decline and its cause), my immediate presence is crucial. Delivering these insights in person, even if slightly late, is the most direct and effective way to ensure the review proceeds with accurate, up-to-date information. An email might be missed, and preparing a slide would only delay my arrival further.
