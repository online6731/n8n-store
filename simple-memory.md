**(The Director's Voice)**

Alex, the day awaits your command. Your first decision is crucial to setting the tone for this high-stakes presentation day.

How will you begin to seize it?

1.  **Hit the snooze button one more time.** A few extra minutes of sleep will surely make a difference, you think.
2.  **Immediately check your phone for work updates.** The presentation is today; you can't afford to miss anything.
3.  **Head straight to the kitchen to brew some strong coffee.** You'll need the caffeine to tackle the day ahead.
4.  **Jump in the shower immediately to wake yourself up fully.** A quick, refreshing start is key.
