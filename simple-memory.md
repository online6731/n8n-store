**The Director:** I understand, Alex. Your thought process highlights a keen awareness of client priorities, team dynamics, and personal preparedness. That's precisely the kind of strategic thinking that thrives at Innovate Solutions.

However, the clock is ticking, and Leo's urgent email is waiting. To move forward in the simulation, I need a definitive action from you.

Considering your priorities, which of the following is your first move, or what specific alternative action do you wish to take?

1.  **Dive straight into Leo's email.** It's marked urgent, and Project Aether is a big deal.
2.  **Check other emails first.** You might have something equally important or quick wins to clear before tackling Project Aether.
3.  **Grab a coffee from the breakroom.** You can review emails with a fresh cup in hand.
4.  **Quickly review yesterday's notes for Project Aether.** Refresh your memory before engaging with new updates.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
