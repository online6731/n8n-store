**(The Director):**

**(Narrator Persona)**
A smart move. A quick acknowledgment goes a long way in a fast-paced environment like Innovate Solutions. You swiftly type out a brief reply to Sarah: "Received, Sarah. On it now. Will prioritize the Quantum Leap slides. Let's sync at 10:30 AM." You hit send, the digital ping confirming its departure.

With that done, your focus shifts entirely to the Quantum Leap presentation. It's **8:55 AM** as you navigate to the shared drive, pulling up the extensive slide deck. The title slide flashes, "Quantum Leap: Strategic Growth Initiatives." As you begin to scroll through, checking for consistency and errors, you notice a recurring theme: several key data points on market projections seem incredibly optimistic, bordering on unrealistic, compared to the preliminary research you vaguely recall seeing a few weeks ago. Specifically, the Q3 growth projection on slide 17 and the ROI forecast on slide 22 jump out.

You remember an internal market research report that came out last week which painted a more conservative picture. If these numbers are indeed off, it could severely undermine the client's trust, especially since their decision-making hinges on accurate data.

What's your immediate action regarding these questionable figures?

1.  **Flag the slides and make a note to discuss with Sarah at 10:30 AM:** Continue reviewing the rest of the deck for other issues, but don't stop on these.
2.  **Cross-reference the data immediately:** Pause your current review and search the shared drive for the latest market research report to verify the figures on slides 17 and 22.
3.  **Make a minor correction to the numbers yourself:** Adjust them to what you *think* is correct based on your memory, assuming Sarah will approve later.
4.  **Send a quick message to a colleague:** Ask a peer if they've seen the latest market research report and can confirm the numbers.
