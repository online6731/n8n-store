To truly deepen my understanding of these core product trends, the most critical next step is to **calculate the precise quarter-over-quarter growth percentage for each product line.**

Knowing the exact percentage change will provide a clear, quantifiable measure of performance, allowing me to accurately compare the growth (or decline) of each product against the others. This will then naturally lead to identifying the strongest/weakest performers and provide the necessary context to investigate any dips, like that in 'Synergy Streamline', with a precise understanding of its magnitude.
