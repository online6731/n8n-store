My mental outline and now the data loading are complete. Before I start drawing conclusions or building visualizations, I need to ensure the integrity of the data itself.

My immediate next move will be to **perform a quick data validation check**. I'll quickly scan for missing values, outliers, or any obvious data entry errors within Tableau. This foundational step is crucial to ensure the reliability of all subsequent analysis. There's no point in building complex visualizations or making strategic decisions if the underlying data is flawed.
