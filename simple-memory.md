I've uncovered a significant piece of information: the 'Other' revenue spike was a one-off, high-value contract. This changes the narrative of Q3's performance considerably, especially concerning organic, sustainable growth.

My next strategic step will be to **adjust my overall Q3 interpretation**. I need to mentally, and perhaps visually within Tableau (by temporarily excluding or highlighting the Global Nexus Corp. project), differentiate between the core, recurring revenue streams from our established product lines and this exceptional, non-recurring win. This adjusted perspective is crucial for accurately assessing the underlying health and trajectory of our business before I dive into more detailed product-line comparisons or deeper dives. It ensures my analysis is grounded in a realistic understanding of our growth drivers.
