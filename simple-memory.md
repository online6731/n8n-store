The email reads:

*Subject: Urgent: Project Aether Kick-off Prep - Action Required*
*From: Leo Maxwell (Senior Manager)*
*To: Alex Chen*
*Date: Today, 8:40 AM*

*Hi Alex,*

*Hope you had a good evening. We've just received a critical update on Project Aether from Quantum Innovations. They've decided to accelerate the timeline for the initial discovery phase, pushing our internal kick-off to **this afternoon at 2:00 PM**.*

*This means we need to fast-track our prep work. My key priority right now is to finalize the **initial client brief and the agenda for this afternoon's internal kick-off**. I need a strong, concise draft of both by **1:00 PM**. I'm currently tied up in an unexpected client call until 10:30 AM, but I'll be available to review your draft immediately after.*

*Could you please take the lead on pulling together the initial bullet points for both the client brief (key objectives, scope, expected outcomes) and the internal kick-off agenda (key topics, attendees, roles)? Focus on what we know so far and what questions we need answers to from Quantum.*

*Let me know if you hit any roadblocks. This is a high-visibility project, and our agility here is crucial.*

*Thanks, Leo*

The email leaves you with a clear, time-sensitive task. It's now **9:05 AM**, and the challenge of a compressed timeline for Project Aether is front and center. You've got approximately four hours until Leo needs the drafts.

What's your next move to tackle Leo's request?

1.  **Start drafting immediately.** Open a new document and begin outlining the brief and agenda.
2.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** She worked on the initial proposal for Project Aether; she might have useful insights or existing materials.
3.  **Review existing Project Aether files.** You might have some preliminary notes or documents from earlier discussions about Quantum Innovations.
4.  **Send a quick confirmation email to Leo.** Acknowledge receipt and confirm you're on it, perhaps asking a clarifying question if you have one.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
