Before diving into the numbers, I want to ensure my approach is structured and efficient.

I'll choose to **mentally outline my analysis plan**. I'll take these ten minutes to consider the key questions I need to answer for Q3, potential variances to look out for based on the Q2 review, and the types of visualizations that will best communicate the findings. This proactive planning will streamline my actual data analysis, ensuring I hit the ground running at 10:00 AM with a clear roadmap.
