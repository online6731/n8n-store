Having just created the basic trend line for Q3 and noting its general upward trajectory, the most logical and insightful next step is to understand this performance in relation to the previous quarter.

Therefore, I will **cross-reference the Q3 trend with your Q2 insights**. This will allow me to immediately compare the overall performance against the previous quarter's trends, noting if the growth patterns are similar, accelerated, or if there are any significant deviations. This direct comparison will provide crucial context and highlight areas where Q3 performance diverged or continued from Q2, guiding my subsequent, more granular analysis.
