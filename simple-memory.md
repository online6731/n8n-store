**The Director:** Good morning, Alex. It's **8:45 AM**, and the Innovate Solutions office is already buzzing with the quiet hum of productivity. The aroma of strong coffee mingles with the faint scent of new carpet, a signature blend of the early workday. Your monitor flickers to life, displaying a handful of new emails. Your inbox is a familiar sight: a mix of company-wide announcements, team updates, and a few client-related queries.

One particular email catches your eye, marked with a high priority flag from Leo Maxwell: "Urgent: Project Aether Kick-off Prep." It landed in your inbox just minutes ago. This is the new, high-stakes digital transformation project for Quantum Innovations, and Leo, your Senior Manager, is clearly eager to get a head start.

What's your first move this morning?

1.  **Dive straight into Leo's email.** It's marked urgent, and Project Aether is a big deal.
2.  **Check other emails first.** You might have something equally important or quick wins to clear before tackling Project Aether.
3.  **Grab a coffee from the breakroom.** You can review emails with a fresh cup in hand.
4.  **Quickly review yesterday's notes for Project Aether.** Refresh your memory before engaging with new updates.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
