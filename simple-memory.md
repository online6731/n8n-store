You close your notes and head towards the designated conference room for the 1:00 PM Internal Strategy Meeting. As you enter, you see a mix of familiar faces and some senior leaders you've only seen in passing. David Lee, the Project Manager from your morning meeting, is already there, along with a few other consultants, some analysts, and a couple of managers from other departments like HR and Marketing. The meeting seems to be less formal, with people grabbing seats around a large table.

The meeting begins promptly at **1:00 PM**. Robert Peterson, a senior partner, kicks off the discussion. "Alright team, welcome to our Q4 internal strategy sync. We're here to brainstorm, share updates, and ensure we're all aligned as we move into the busiest part of the year. Let's start with a quick round-robin of updates on current internal initiatives."

The discussion progresses, with various team members providing updates on initiatives ranging from new internal software rollouts to professional development programs. You listen intently, taking notes, and occasionally connecting how these internal efforts might impact client projects. You contribute by briefly mentioning your involvement in Project Horizon when the topic of project management methodologies comes up, highlighting a recent efficiency gain.

**It's now 1:25 PM.** The meeting is still ongoing, but you're conscious of your upcoming 1:30 PM check-in with Sarah. The conversation has shifted to potential cross-functional collaboration opportunities for Q4.

What's your next move?

1.  Politely excuse yourself from the meeting a few minutes early to meet Sarah.
2.  Send a quick internal chat message to Sarah letting her know you'll be a few minutes late.
3.  Continue listening to the current discussion, hoping the meeting ends on time.
4.  Raise a question about how new internal initiatives might impact current client projects, linking to Project Horizon.
