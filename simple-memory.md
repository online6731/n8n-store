You quickly open your notes and the summary you pulled from the Q2 report, overlaying that mental framework onto the Q3 trend line in Tableau. You observe that while both quarters showed strong overall growth, Q3's growth was more consistent throughout July and August, whereas Q2 had seen a more pronounced mid-quarter surge. The late-September rebound in Q3 mirrors a similar strong finish in Q2, suggesting a consistent pattern of end-of-quarter push. However, Q3's "Other" revenue spike you noted earlier stands out as a unique deviation compared to Q2, which had a more evenly distributed revenue stream across product lines. This direct comparison provides a richer context, highlighting both continuation and specific new patterns.

It's now **10:35 AM**. You've gained a crucial perspective on Q3's performance by comparing it directly to Q2, identifying both consistent trends and interesting deviations. The office continues its rhythmic hum, signaling the deeper dive into the workday.

With this comparative understanding in hand, what's your next strategic step in analyzing the Q3 data?

1.  **Segment the Q3 data by product line:** Understand which products drove the overall trends in Q3 and compare their individual performances to Q2.
2.  **Investigate the late-September sales surge in Q3 more closely:** Dig into the specific factors that contributed to this recurring end-of-quarter push.
3.  **Delve into the 'Other' revenue spike in Q3:** Determine the cause and significance of this deviation from Q2's pattern.
4.  **Begin drafting key takeaways for your report:** Start outlining your initial findings for presentation.
