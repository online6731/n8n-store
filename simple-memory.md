**The Director:** Excellent, Alex. That's a decisive and efficient move. With a refined draft in hand and Leo's limited availability, direct engagement is precisely what's needed.

It's **10:38 AM**. You quickly save your updated draft and walk over to Leo Maxwell's desk, which is just a short distance away. He's finishing up a brief phone call, nodding, and then hangs up as you approach. He looks up, a slight smile on his face.

"Alex, perfect timing," Leo says, gesturing to the empty chair beside his desk. "What have you got?"

You quickly open your laptop and pull up the revised draft. "Hi Leo. Thanks for the quick update on Cognitive Apex. I've gone through the existing files and Sarah also shared some insights. Based on that, and especially your new info, I've drafted some initial bullet points for the client brief and the internal kick-off agenda. I tried to integrate the AI partnership and the need for a scalable data foundation as a core focus."

Leo leans in, skimming the document on your screen. His eyes quickly dart over the objectives, scope, and agenda points. "Good, good," he murmurs, nodding. "Emphasizing Cognitive Apex and the foundational data piece is exactly right. The 'Phase 1 - Data Integration Quick Win' is smart, Alex – it shows immediate value while building for the long-term AI strategy. Nice addition with the data silos from Sarah's input too."

He taps a section on the client brief. "Just one minor tweak here. For 'Expected Outcomes,' let's add something about setting Quantum Innovations up as an 'industry leader in AI-driven operational efficiency.' It ties it all together nicely."

He glances at his watch. "Okay, that looks like a very strong start. I need to jump on my next call, but keep refining this. I'll block out **1:15 PM to 1:45 PM** in my calendar for a final review before the 2:00 PM kick-off. That gives you some solid time."

"Any immediate questions?" Leo asks, already starting to gather his notes for his next meeting.

You quickly respond. "No immediate questions, Leo. This clarity helps a lot. I'll refine this, and I'll see you at 1:15 PM for the final review."

"Great," Leo says, already half out of his seat. "Keep up the excellent work, Alex."

Leo walks off towards a meeting room. You return to your desk. It's now **10:45 AM**. You have a well-received, partially refined draft, and a clear deadline of **1:15 PM** for the final review with Leo. The core of the brief and agenda is solid, but Leo's suggestion about positioning Quantum as an "industry leader" is a strategic refinement.

What's your next strategic move?

1.  **Immediately implement Leo's suggested tweak** and then continue refining the existing draft.
2.  **Conduct a quick, focused online search for Quantum Innovations and Cognitive Apex.** Now that you have the specific partner name, you can find more targeted information to further strengthen the brief.
3.  **Review your internal kick-off agenda with a focus on potential attendees.** Consider who else within Innovate Solutions might need to be at the 2:00 PM meeting.
4.  **Take a short break to mentally reset.** You've been working intensely and could use a brief refresh before the next push.
