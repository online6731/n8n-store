**The Director:** Alex, that's an exceptionally well-reasoned and proactive approach. Your breakdown demonstrates a clear understanding of the task's urgency, the need for preparation, and leveraging available resources, all while keeping Leo's timeline in mind. That's precisely the kind of strategic thinking Innovate Solutions values.

You've outlined a strong sequence of actions. Now, to translate that plan into immediate execution, what is the *very first* concrete step you will take? It's **9:08 AM**, and every minute counts towards that 1:00 PM deadline.

1.  **Send a quick confirmation email to Leo.** Acknowledge receipt and confirm you're on it, perhaps asking a clarifying question if you have one.
2.  **Review existing Project Aether files.** Begin gathering preliminary notes or documents from earlier discussions.
3.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** Ask if she has any useful insights or existing materials from the initial proposal.
4.  **Start drafting immediately.** Open a new document and begin outlining the brief and agenda based on initial thoughts.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
