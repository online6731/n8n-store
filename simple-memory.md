You listen attentively as Emily describes the progress on feedback collection. She explains that the team has gathered over 100 survey responses and conducted 15 in-depth interviews. "The initial themes emerging," Emily states, "point towards strong satisfaction with the core functionality, but some confusion around the advanced features and integration with existing client systems." She outlines the categorization process they're using to group similar feedback points.

**It's 10:40 AM.** Emily finishes her update, and David nods. "Thanks, Emily. That's a comprehensive overview. It sounds like we have a good grasp on the qualitative side of things." He then turns to the agenda's third major point. "Okay, let's talk about 'Next Steps for the Client Presentation.' We're targeting the end of the month. Sarah, what are your thoughts on structuring this, especially now that we have both the conversion rates and the initial feedback themes?"

Sarah begins to outline a proposed structure for the client deck, focusing on a narrative that combines the quantitative success with insights from the qualitative feedback to suggest areas for refinement.

What's your next move during this discussion?

1.  Offer to help with specific sections of the client presentation.
2.  Suggest a key visual or data point from the conversion rates that should be included.
3.  Take detailed notes on Sarah's proposed structure.
4.  Ask about the specific audience for the client presentation to tailor content.
