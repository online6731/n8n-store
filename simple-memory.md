**(The Director's Voice)**

Alex, I sense the internal gears turning â€“ the blend of anticipation, the drive to excel, and the strategic thinking even before your feet hit the floor. This self-awareness will be an asset today.

However, to move forward, a concrete action is needed. What will Alex *do* right now, at 7:00 AM, to kickstart this pivotal day?

1.  **Hit the snooze button one more time.** A few extra minutes of sleep will surely make a difference, you think.
2.  **Immediately check your phone for work updates.** The presentation is today; you can't afford to miss anything.
3.  **Head straight to the kitchen to brew some strong coffee.** You'll need the caffeine to tackle the day ahead.
4.  **Jump in the shower immediately to wake yourself up fully.** A quick, refreshing start is key.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
