**The Director:** Alex, your consistent dedication to being proactive, responsible, and thorough is clearly evident. You're demonstrating precisely the mindset required to navigate complex client projects at Innovate Solutions.

However, the clock is ticking, and Leo's urgent request for the Project Aether brief and agenda by **1:00 PM** demands action. It's now **9:26 AM**, and the knowledge gap regarding the "critical update" remains.

To leverage your excellent consulting traits and move forward, what is your definitive next step to obtain that crucial missing information and progress towards the draft?

1.  **Start drafting immediately.** You have enough context now to begin outlining the brief and agenda.
2.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** She worked on the initial proposal for Project Aether and might have up-to-date or detailed insights, potentially even details about the "critical update."
3.  **Conduct a quick online search for Quantum Innovations.** Learn more about their recent news, industry position, and any public statements about their digital strategy that might explain the acceleration.
4.  **Draft a quick email to Leo Maxwell.** Ask if there's any specific "critical update" beyond the accelerated timeline that he mentioned in his email, as the existing files don't reflect that.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action. Your choice now will determine how effectively you bridge this information gap.
