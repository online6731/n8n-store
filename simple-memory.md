Welcome, Alex. The stage is set. Your workday at Innovate Solutions begins now.

***

The fluorescent lights of Innovate Solutions hum with a gentle, consistent rhythm above you. It's **8:55 AM**. The office is steadily filling up, the quiet murmur of morning greetings and keyboard clicks replacing the earlier silence. Your mug of lukewarm coffee sits beside your laptop, a testament to your early start. David, your project lead, is already at his desk, tapping away with his usual intensity, occasionally pushing his glasses up his nose. Sarah from marketing, ever the early bird, is chatting animatedly near the communal coffee machine with a few other colleagues.

Your first official task of the day, as always, is the **9:00 AM daily stand-up** for the "Project Phoenix" team. It's held in the small huddle room just down the hall, where everyone shares what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers. You've got a couple of small updates from yesterday's data analysis, but you're also aware of the looming deadline for the client proposal later this week.

What do you do?

1.  **Head straight to the huddle room:** Get a good spot and mentally prepare your updates.
2.  **Quickly review your notes:** Double-check your data analysis findings and today's priorities before heading to the stand-up.
3.  **Grab a fresh cup of coffee:** You'll need the caffeine to be fully alert for the meeting.
4.  **Briefly chat with David:** Ask if there's anything specific he wants you to highlight during the stand-up.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
