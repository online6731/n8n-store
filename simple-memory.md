You shift your focus from the Project Horizon presentation. You open your calendar again and click on the 1:00 PM 'Internal Strategy Meeting.' The description is concise: "Review of Q4 internal initiatives. Discussion on cross-functional collaboration and resource allocation." There's no specific agenda document linked, suggesting it might be more of a discussion-based meeting.

You recall that these internal strategy meetings often involve updates from different departments and a collaborative effort to identify efficiencies or potential bottlenecks for the upcoming quarter. As a Junior Consultant, your role would likely be to listen, learn, and contribute where appropriate, perhaps by offering insights from ongoing client projects.

**It's 12:25 PM.** You have about 35 minutes before the meeting, and you still haven't had lunch.

What's your next step?

1.  Quickly grab a light lunch to eat at your desk while you prep for the meeting.
2.  Do some quick research on Innovate Solutions' Q4 internal initiatives if possible.
3.  Prepare a few general questions about internal processes or resource allocation.
4.  Focus on reviewing your overall project load to be ready to discuss resource needs.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
