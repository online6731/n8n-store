You delve into the newly imported Q3 data within Tableau, activating its validation tools. You quickly run through a series of checks: scanning for null values across key metrics like revenue and client IDs, looking for any immediate outliers in sales figures that might suggest data entry errors, and ensuring data types are correctly assigned. The dataset appears remarkably clean; a testament to Innovate Solutions' robust data collection processes. You note a single minor anomaly – a small segment of 'Other' revenue that spiked unexpectedly in August – but it's not a glaring error that halts progress, more a point of interest for later. This quick, diligent check confirms the data's integrity, giving you confidence in your upcoming analysis.

It's now **10:15 AM**. The initial data setup and validation are complete. You have a clean, reliable Q3 dataset ready for deeper exploration within Tableau. The low murmur of colleagues on calls and typing on keyboards is a steady background to your focused work.

With your validated Q3 data at hand, what is your next analytical step?

1.  **Create a basic trend line visualization of total Q3 sales:** Get an immediate high-level overview of performance.
2.  **Filter the data to focus on key growth areas identified in your Q2 review:** Immediately apply your historical context.
3.  **Begin segmenting the data by product line and region:** Start breaking down the overall performance.
