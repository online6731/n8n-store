Having refined my understanding of Q3's true organic growth by isolating the unique Global Nexus project, it's essential to now apply this nuanced perspective to our core business performance.

My next strategic step will be to **compare individual organic product line performance in Q3 to Q2**. This will allow me to precisely identify how our established, recurring revenue streams – "Innovate Catalyst," "Synergy Streamline," and "Strategic Growth Package" – have evolved quarter-over-quarter. By looking at these core products side-by-side with Q2, I can accurately assess their growth rates, identify consistent trends, and pinpoint any shifts in their individual trajectories, free from the distortion of the one-off project. This comparison will provide a robust understanding of our sustainable business health.
