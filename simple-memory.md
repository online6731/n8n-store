As you finish reading, the digital clock on your monitor ticks over to **8:55 AM**. The office noise has picked up, and you can see colleagues beginning to drift towards Conference Room B, presumably for the stand-up. You now have a clear understanding of your immediate tasks and what David expects.

What's your next move as the stand-up approaches?

1.  **Head directly to Conference Room B:** Get there early to secure a good spot.
2.  **Quickly review yesterday's data cleansing notes:** Refresh your memory for the stand-up.
3.  **Grab a glass of water:** Stay hydrated before the meeting.
4.  **Send a quick message to David:** Ask a clarifying question about the visualization tool.
