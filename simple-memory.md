The 'Other' revenue spike is a clear anomaly that disproportionately impacted August's overall figures and represents a significant deviation from Q2. Understanding its source is critical for accurate reporting and future planning.

My next strategic step will be to **deep-dive into the 'Other' revenue spike**. I need to investigate the specific transactions or clients that comprise this anomaly. This will help determine if it was a one-time event, a miscategorization, or a new, unexpected revenue stream, providing essential context before I can fully interpret the Q3 performance or compare it accurately to Q2.
