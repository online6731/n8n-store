Recognizing the time crunch and the need to be fueled for the upcoming meetings, you decide to combine lunch with prep. You quickly head to the office kitchen, grab a pre-made salad or a quick sandwich, and bring it back to your desk.

As you eat, you open a fresh note document and begin to mentally prepare for the 1:00 PM Internal Strategy Meeting. Since there's no agenda, you consider the types of topics that might come up: progress on ongoing internal initiatives, potential roadblocks, or ideas for improving cross-functional collaboration. You jot down a few bullet points about your current Project Horizon workload and any potential resource needs that might arise. You also think about a couple of general, high-level questions you could ask to show engagement, focusing on learning more about broader company strategy.

**It's 12:55 PM.** You've finished your lunch and have a clear, albeit brief, set of notes for the meeting. The office ambiance has shifted slightly; the lunch rush is winding down, and people are starting to gather for afternoon sessions.

What's your next move as the 1:00 PM meeting approaches?

1.  Head to the meeting room for the 1:00 PM internal strategy meeting.
2.  Do a final quick check of your Project Horizon presentation outline.
3.  Send a quick email to Sarah confirming the 1:30 PM check-in.
4.  Review your general inbox for any new emails.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
