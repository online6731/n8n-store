I've gained valuable high-level insights from comparing Q3 and Q2. Now, it's time to understand the drivers behind these trends at a more granular level.

My next strategic step will be to **segment the Q3 data by product line**. This will allow me to see which specific products or services contributed to the overall Q3 trends, including the general growth and the late-September surge. It will also help me identify the source of the 'Other' revenue spike and understand its proportion relative to other product lines, providing critical context before I delve into that specific anomaly. This systematic breakdown is essential for a comprehensive analysis.
