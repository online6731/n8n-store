**The Director:** Alex, your consistent focus on responsibility, strategic thinking, and understanding the 'why' behind actions is exactly what makes a successful consultant at Innovate Solutions. It's clear you're building a strong foundation for your day.

However, to move the simulation forward and demonstrate that proactive approach, we need a specific, immediate action. The workday at Innovate Solutions is dynamic, and inaction, even while thoughtful, can have consequences.

Considering your drive to address urgent tasks and your manager's priorities, which of the following actions will you take right now?

1.  **Dive straight into Leo's email.** It's marked urgent, and Project Aether is a big deal.
2.  **Check other emails first.** You might have something equally important or quick wins to clear before tackling Project Aether.
3.  **Grab a coffee from the breakroom.** You can review emails with a fresh cup in hand.
4.  **Quickly review yesterday's notes for Project Aether.** Refresh your memory before engaging with new updates.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action. The simulation awaits your decision.
