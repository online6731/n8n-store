Welcome, Alex. It's **8:45 AM** on a crisp Tuesday morning, and you're at your desk at Innovate Solutions. The office is already buzzing with the low hum of productivity – keyboards clicking, hushed conversations, and the distant whir of the espresso machine. Your monitor flickers to life, displaying your inbox. A quick scan shows a mix of internal communications and client-related queries. Your calendar for the day, visible in a smaller window, highlights a **10:00 AM** team sync for the 'Project Horizon' client, followed by a **1:00 PM** internal strategy meeting. You also notice a flagged email from Sarah Chen, the Senior Consultant you report to, with the subject 'Urgent - Project Horizon Data.'

What's your first move?

1.  Prioritize Sarah's email – it's marked "Urgent."
2.  Review your calendar and prep for the 10:00 AM sync meeting.
3.  Catch up on general emails and news, easing into the day.
4.  Grab a coffee from the breakroom before diving into anything.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
