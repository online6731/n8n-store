You opt for a clarifying question, "David, when you say 'best visualization tool,' are we aiming for internal analysis or client presentation?"

David nods, appreciating the question. "Good point, Alex. For the Q3 projections, we need a tool that can serve both purposes, but with a lean towards client presentation. We'll be using these visuals to highlight key growth areas and potential bottlenecks for Apex's leadership tomorrow. So, something that's professional, clear, and ideally, allows for some interactivity if we present live."

He pauses, giving you a moment. "Does that help you narrow it down?"

You consider your options, the prompt for a specific tool now clearer.

1.  **Suggest Tableau:** "Yes, that helps. Considering both, I'd lean towards Tableau. It's excellent for creating interactive client-facing dashboards and we already have licenses."
2.  **Suggest Power BI:** "Given the need for client presentation, Power BI could also be a strong contender, especially if Apex Innovations uses Microsoft products heavily."
3.  **Suggest a simpler tool:** "For clarity and ease of sharing, perhaps a well-designed Excel dashboard with embedded charts would be sufficient?"
4.  **Acknowledge and defer:** "That clarifies it perfectly. I'll solidify my recommendation during the data analysis phase and touch base with you before 11:30 AM."
