You consider your options for the brief window. While starting the analysis early is tempting, ensuring your workspace, both physical and digital, is primed for deep work will likely pay dividends.

You decide to take a moment to **organize your digital files**. You create a new, clearly labeled folder on your shared drive: "Project Phoenix - Q3 Sales Projections Analysis." Within it, you nest subfolders for "Raw Data," "Cleaned Data," "Visualizations," and "Draft Findings." You then drag the relevant Q3 sales data and yesterday's data cleansing log into their respective new homes. It's a small act, but it brings a sense of calm and order, setting you up for focused work.

As you finish this quick organizational task, the digital clock on your monitor shows **9:25 AM**. You've got a solid half-hour before the official 10:00 AM start time for data analysis, and your digital workspace is now perfectly prepared.

What will you do with the remaining time before you deep-dive into the Q3 sales projections?

1.  **Start the data analysis now:** Get a significant head start on identifying trends.
2.  **Grab a coffee:** The caffeine might be beneficial for intense analytical work.
3.  **Quickly check your personal messages:** A brief mental break before focused work.
4.  **Review previous Q2 sales projections:** Gain context and identify patterns from the last quarter.
