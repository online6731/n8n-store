**(The Director's Voice, Narrator Persona)**

You've accurately pinpointed the critical challenge, Alex. While your foundation on market size and competitors is solid, the "potential growth vectors" section, as you've observed, remains abstract and lacks the compelling clarity Liam is looking for. With only 45 minutes until your sync at 10:15 AM, every decision counts.

What's your next move to refine the summary and prepare for the review?

1.  **Focus solely on "growth vectors":** Dedicate the remaining time to making this section as robust and compelling as possible, even if it means less polish elsewhere.
2.  **Start drafting the summary now:** Compile what you have, even if incomplete, to ensure a coherent document for Liam, then quickly flesh out the growth vectors within that structure.
3.  **Prioritize the most impactful data:** Craft a strong, concise narrative for the market size and competitor sections, and provide a high-level overview for "growth vectors" if time is extremely tight.
4.  **Quickly search for existing summaries:** See if there are any previous internal reports or external analyses that could provide a quick framework or key insights for the "growth vectors" section.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
