**The Director:** Absolutely, Alex. That's a highly intelligent and efficient strategy. Going directly to the source for the most recent "critical update" is the most direct path to ensuring accuracy, especially under a tight deadline. Your prioritization is spot on.

It's **9:29 AM**, and you immediately open a new email draft.

*To: Leo Maxwell (Senior Manager)*
*Subject: Re: Urgent: Project Aether Kick-off Prep - Action Required*

*Hi Leo,*

*Thanks for the urgent update. I've just seen your email and I'm on it. I've reviewed the existing Project Aether files, but I wanted to quickly confirm if there's any specific detail about the "critical update" from Quantum Innovations that might not be reflected in our existing documentation? Understanding the nuances of this update will be crucial for drafting the most accurate brief and agenda for the 1:00 PM deadline.*

*No worries at all if you're tied up with your current call. I'll proceed with drafting based on what I have and will factor in any additional details once you're free at 10:30 AM. Just wanted to ensure I don't miss anything vital.*

*Best,*
*Alex*

You hit 'Send'. The email disappears from your outbox, a brief ping confirming its dispatch.

It's now **9:30 AM**. Leo is on a call until 10:30 AM, so you won't get an immediate response, but you've proactively sought the critical information. You have approximately an hour until Leo is free, and then about 2.5 hours until the 1:00 PM draft deadline.

What's your next strategic move while you await Leo's availability?

1.  **Start drafting the client brief and internal agenda.** You have some foundational documents and can build on those, leaving gaps for Leo's update.
2.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** She worked on the initial proposal and might have other insights or materials, even if not the "critical update" itself.
3.  **Conduct a quick online search for Quantum Innovations.** Dig into recent news or their public profile for any clues about what might have triggered the acceleration.
4.  **Organize your workspace for optimal efficiency.** Clear your desk, open relevant applications, and prepare for focused drafting.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
