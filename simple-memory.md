You open your inbox one last time. You scroll through the latest emails. Thankfully, there are no new urgent flagged messages or critical client requests that demand immediate attention. You see a few internal newsletters and a meeting invite for next week that you can address tomorrow. It's a clear inbox, a welcome sight at the end of a busy day.

**It's 4:55 PM.** Your screen glows softly in the increasingly quiet office. You've ensured no surprises are waiting for you in the morning.

What's your very last action for the workday?

1.  Organize your desk and pack up your bag, ready to head home.
2.  Send a quick "Good night" chat to Sarah and Emily.
3.  Review one last time the Project Horizon presentation outline.
4.  Make a mental note of one key learning from today to reflect on.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
