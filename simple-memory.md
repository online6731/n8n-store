You decide it's a good idea to ensure you're fully prepared and refreshed. You quickly walk to the breakroom, fill your water bottle, and then head towards the conference room booked for the Project Horizon sync.

You arrive a few minutes early, finding David Lee, the Project Manager, already there, setting up the projector. He nods a greeting. Sarah Chen and Emily White arrive shortly after, and the room begins to fill.

**It's 10:00 AM.** The meeting officially begins. David kicks off by reviewing the agenda. Sarah then turns to the first key discussion point: "Review of Q3 Client Engagement Metrics, specifically conversion rates." She looks at you, "Alex, thanks again for pulling those Q3 conversion rates. Could you walk us through the key takeaways from that data?"

What do you do?

1.  Present the conversion rates clearly, highlighting the figures you found.
2.  Defer to Sarah, asking if she wants to present the data first.
3.  Ask a clarifying question about what specific takeaways they are looking for.
4.  Quickly check your notes one last time before speaking.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
