**The Director:** You've hit on a crucial point, Alex. Your existing files offer a foundation, but the "critical update" and accelerated timeline from Leo's email suggest there's new, vital information missing. Relying solely on older documents for a fast-moving project like Project Aether would be a misstep.

It's **9:24 AM**, and you're aiming for that 1:00 PM draft deadline. Getting accurate, up-to-date context is paramount.

What's your next, most effective move to bridge this knowledge gap?

1.  **Start drafting immediately.** You have enough context now to begin outlining the brief and agenda.
2.  **Reach out to Sarah Jenkins.** She worked on the initial proposal for Project Aether and might have up-to-date or detailed insights, potentially even details about the "critical update."
3.  **Conduct a quick online search for Quantum Innovations.** Learn more about their recent news, industry position, and any public statements about their digital strategy that might explain the acceleration.
4.  **Draft a quick email to Leo Maxwell.** Ask if there's any specific "critical update" beyond the accelerated timeline that he mentioned in his email, as the existing files don't reflect that.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
