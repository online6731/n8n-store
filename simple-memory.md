You adjust your view in Tableau, perhaps creating a duplicate chart where the 'Other' category's impact is either filtered out or clearly isolated. This mental recalibration, reinforced by the visual adjustment, immediately provides a more nuanced understanding of Q3. You realize that while the quarter was undeniably strong, a significant portion of its overall uplift, particularly in August, stemmed from that singular, non-recurring Global Nexus Corp. project. This clarifies that while a fantastic win, it doesn't represent the sustained, organic growth trajectory of Innovate Solutions' core offerings. The underlying growth of "Innovate Catalyst" and "Synergy Streamline" is still robust and impressive, but the *rate* of overall growth, when stripped of the Global Nexus anomaly, appears more consistent with the solid (but not explosive) expansion seen in Q2. This refined perspective is crucial for providing accurate insights to leadership.

It's now **11:20 AM**. You've gained a refined and accurate understanding of Q3's true organic growth drivers. The office is bustling, and the late morning energy is palpable.

With this clarified perspective on Q3's organic growth, what is your next strategic step in the data analysis?

1.  **Analyze the "Innovate Catalyst" performance in greater detail:** Focus on the main organic growth driver's specific success factors.
2.  **Compare individual organic product line performance in Q3 to Q2:** Deep dive into quarter-over-quarter trends for the core business.
3.  **Investigate the late-September sales surge specifically for core products:** Understand the drivers behind this recurring organic push.
4.  **Begin to outline the structure of your Q3 performance report:** Start thinking about how to present these findings.
