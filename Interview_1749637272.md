 

Hello, Alex. Welcome to the Emotional Intelligence assessment for the Project Manager position at Innovate Inc.

My name is Elara, and I will be guiding you through this simulation. Over the next hour, you will be presented with 10 scenarios designed to mirror the dynamic challenges and interpersonal situations you might encounter in this role.

Your responses will shape how the narrative unfolds. There are no perfect answers; instead, focus on responding as you authentically would. This will help us understand how you navigate the complexities of the modern workplace.

Let's begin.

**Scenario 1 of 10**

You've just settled at your desk with your morning coffee. You open your inbox and see a new email from your direct manager, Anya Sharma. The subject line is "Urgent: Project Phoenix Update." You presented your latest progress report to her just yesterday, and you thought it went well. As you read the email, your stomach tightens.

Anya's tone is uncharacteristically blunt. She writes, "Alex, I've reviewed the Project Phoenix report again, and I'm frankly disappointed. The risk assessment is superficial, and the projections are overly optimistic. This is not the level of detail I expect. We need to schedule an emergency meeting today to get this back on track."

This feedback feels like a punch to the gut. It's sharp, direct, and very different from Anya's usually supportive style.

What is your immediate internal reaction?

1.  Feel defensive and a little angry. The feedback seems unfair, and you start mentally listing all the reasons why your report was solid.
2.  Feel a wave of anxiety. You worry youâ€™ve seriously misjudged the situation and start questioning your performance and Anya's confidence in you.
3.  Feel a flash of surprise and disappointment, but you consciously decide to pause and take a few deep breaths before reacting. You recognize the emotional sting but don't let it consume you.
4.  Feel confused more than anything. You immediately wonder what you missed and what might be happening with Anya to cause such a strong and unusual reaction.

You take a moment, acknowledging the sting of the feedback without letting it dictate your reaction. You center yourself with a few deep breaths. The email still requires a response. Your priority is to understand the situation fully and address Anya's concerns constructively.

What is your first action?

1.  Reply immediately, writing: "Anya, I'm sorry you feel that way. I was confident in the report, but I'm available to meet whenever works for you today."
2.  Walk over to a trusted colleague's desk, someone who also works with Anya, and discreetly ask if they've noticed if she's been under a lot of pressure lately.
3.  Reply immediately, writing: "Anya, thank you for the direct feedback. I'll block out my calendar for the rest of the day. Can you point to the specific sections in the risk assessment you want me to rework beforehand so I can come to the meeting with some initial revisions?"
4.  Immediately open your calendar and send Anya an invitation for an hour-long meeting titled "Project Phoenix Discussion" with no other text, waiting for her to accept and lead the conversation.

You hit send. Your approach is direct, professional, and solution-focused. A few minutes pass. Just as you're pulling up the report to get a head start, a new email notification pops up. It's from Anya.

The subject is the same: "Re: Project Phoenix Risk Assessment"

The body is short:

"Good. See attached. My notes are in the comments.

Specifically, the financial projections in Section 4.2 don't account for the Q3 supply chain volatility we discussed, and the competitor analysis in Section 5 is superficial. It misses the market entry of 'Innovatech Solutions' entirely.

I've cleared my schedule from 2-3 PM. Be ready to walk me through your revised models then."

Opening the attachment, you see her comments. She's not wrong. In the rush to meet the deadline, you realize you completely overlooked the recent market entry of Innovatech, a disruptive new competitor. Her criticism, while harsh in its initial delivery, is valid.

The meeting is in three hours. What do you do?

1.  Acknowledge the oversight is legitimate. Block your calendar, silence notifications, and focus entirely on reworking Sections 4.2 and 5 to have a solid, data-backed revision ready for the 2 PM meeting.
2.  Reply to Anya: "Got it, thank you. The Innovatech oversight is on me. I'm starting the rework now and will send a revised draft by 1:45 PM for you to see before we speak."
3.  Forward the email to a junior analyst on your team, asking them to quickly pull all available data on Innovatech and update the financial models before your meeting.
4.  Spend the next hour researching Innovatech to find data that minimizes their impact, hoping to prove that your initial assessment wasn't as far off as Anya believes.
