 

Hello, Alex. Welcome to the Emotional Intelligence assessment for the Project Manager position at Innovate Inc.

My name is Elara, and I will be guiding you through this simulation. Over the next hour, you will be presented with 10 scenarios designed to mirror the dynamic challenges and interpersonal situations you might encounter in this role.

Your responses will shape how the narrative unfolds. There are no perfect answers; instead, focus on responding as you authentically would. This will help us understand how you navigate the complexities of the modern workplace.

Let's begin.

**Scenario 1 of 10**

You've just settled at your desk with your morning coffee. You open your inbox and see a new email from your direct manager, Anya Sharma. The subject line is "Urgent: Project Phoenix Update." You presented your latest progress report to her just yesterday, and you thought it went well. As you read the email, your stomach tightens.

Anya's tone is uncharacteristically blunt. She writes, "Alex, I've reviewed the Project Phoenix report again, and I'm frankly disappointed. The risk assessment is superficial, and the projections are overly optimistic. This is not the level of detail I expect. We need to schedule an emergency meeting today to get this back on track."

This feedback feels like a punch to the gut. It's sharp, direct, and very different from Anya's usually supportive style.

What is your immediate internal reaction?

1.  Feel defensive and a little angry. The feedback seems unfair, and you start mentally listing all the reasons why your report was solid.
2.  Feel a wave of anxiety. You worry youâ€™ve seriously misjudged the situation and start questioning your performance and Anya's confidence in you.
3.  Feel a flash of surprise and disappointment, but you consciously decide to pause and take a few deep breaths before reacting. You recognize the emotional sting but don't let it consume you.
4.  Feel confused more than anything. You immediately wonder what you missed and what might be happening with Anya to cause such a strong and unusual reaction.
