**(The Director):** Welcome, Alex, to another day at Innovate Solutions. The hum of the office is already a familiar symphony around you. Your ergonomic chair feels just right, and the soft glow of your monitor reflects the early morning light filtering through the large windows of the 20th floor. It's **8:50 AM**, and the digital clock in the corner of your screen blinks a silent reminder of the day ahead.

You've just settled in, grabbed a mug of lukewarm coffee from the communal kitchen, and are mentally preparing for the day. A new email notification flashes, pulling your attention to the inbox. It's from Liam, your team lead, with the subject line: "Urgent: Project Phoenix Q3 Report - Data Anomaly."

Liam's email reads:
*"Good morning, Alex. Hope you had a good weekend. We have a slight hitch with the Project Phoenix Q3 report. The latest data pull from the client's system is showing some inconsistencies â€“ particularly in the Q2 vs. Q3 growth projections for the 'Market Penetration' metric. It's critical we resolve this before our 10 AM internal review with Sarah Chen and the client team. Can you prioritize this? Let me know your immediate plan."*

This is an unexpected start to the day. You'd planned to finalize your presentation slides for the afternoon's internal workshop. Now, this.

What's your immediate response to Liam's email?

1.  **Immediately dive into the data:** Open the Project Phoenix files and start cross-referencing Q2 and Q3 data points.
2.  **Reply to Liam asking for more specifics:** Inquire about *which* specific data points are inconsistent or if he has any initial hunches.
3.  **Check in with a colleague:** Ask a peer if they've encountered similar data anomalies with Project Phoenix or this client before.
4.  **Prioritize the workshop slides:** Briefly acknowledge Liam's email, but focus on the pre-planned task for now, hoping to address the data issue later.
