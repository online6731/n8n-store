 

Welcome. This is a dynamic emotional intelligence assessment. I will guide you through 10 scenarios designed to simulate a realistic work environment. Your responses will shape the narrative. There are no right or wrong answers, only your choices and their consequences.

Let's begin.

You are a Senior Project Manager at a fast-growing tech company, Veridian Dynamics. It's Monday morning, and you've just walked into the office.

You open your email and see a message from your direct report, Liam, sent late last night. The subject is 'URGENT: Project Apollo Issue.' The body reads: "Hi, had to push a hotfix over the weekend for a critical bug. It broke the user authentication feature on the staging server. The big client demo is tomorrow morning. I’m really sorry. I tried to fix it, but I’m stuck."

What is your immediate next step?

1.  Immediately call Liam to get a full breakdown of what went wrong and what he's tried so far.
2.  Send a quick email to Liam saying "Thanks for the heads-up. I'm looking into it now. Let's sync in 30 minutes," then start investigating the codebase yourself.
3.  Forward the email to your manager and the head of engineering with the note: "FYI - potential major issue for the client demo tomorrow. Liam is working on it."
4.  Walk over to Liam's desk to talk to him in person, starting with, "Hey, don't worry, we'll figure this out together."
