 

Welcome. This is a dynamic emotional intelligence assessment. I will guide you through 10 scenarios designed to simulate a realistic work environment. Your responses will shape the narrative. There are no right or wrong answers, only your choices and their consequences.

Let's begin.

You are a Senior Project Manager at a fast-growing tech company, Veridian Dynamics. It's Monday morning, and you've just walked into the office.

You open your email and see a message from your direct report, Liam, sent late last night. The subject is 'URGENT: Project Apollo Issue.' The body reads: "Hi, had to push a hotfix over the weekend for a critical bug. It broke the user authentication feature on the staging server. The big client demo is tomorrow morning. I’m really sorry. I tried to fix it, but I’m stuck."

What is your immediate next step?

1.  Immediately call Liam to get a full breakdown of what went wrong and what he's tried so far.
2.  Send a quick email to Liam saying "Thanks for the heads-up. I'm looking into it now. Let's sync in 30 minutes," then start investigating the codebase yourself.
3.  Forward the email to your manager and the head of engineering with the note: "FYI - potential major issue for the client demo tomorrow. Liam is working on it."
4.  Walk over to Liam's desk to talk to him in person, starting with, "Hey, don't worry, we'll figure this out together."

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*

You walk over to Liam’s desk. He’s staring intently at his monitor, looking stressed. He jumps slightly as you approach.

Your calm, reassuring tone makes his shoulders slump in relief. "Oh, hey. Thanks. Man, I'm so sorry about this. I was trying to patch that memory leak from last week. The fix worked in my local environment, but when I deployed it to staging, it somehow conflicted with the authentication service. I've been tracing the dependencies for hours but it's a rabbit hole. The old code won't redeploy cleanly because of a database migration script that already ran. I'm completely swamped."

He gestures helplessly at his screen, which is filled with lines of code and error messages. What do you do?

1.  "Okay, pull up the commit history. Let's do a side-by-side comparison of the changes and the master branch. I'll be your second pair of eyes."
2.  "Don't worry about the old code for a second. Let's focus on a forward fix. Whiteboard it out for me. What are the three most likely points of failure?"
3.  "This sounds bigger than just you and me. I'm going to call Sarah (your manager) and Javier (Head of Engineering) to give them a heads-up and see if we can get another developer, maybe someone from the security team, to help."
4.  "Okay, how about we try rolling back the database manually? It's risky, but it might be the fastest way to get the old code working again."
