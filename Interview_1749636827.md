 

Welcome, Alex. This is an advanced assessment designed to understand your approach to complex workplace situations. We will walk through 10 distinct scenarios at Innovate Inc. Your responses will shape how events unfold. There are no right or wrong answers; simply respond as you genuinely would.

Let's begin with Scenario 1.

It's 9:47 PM on a Sunday. You're winding down, preparing for the week ahead as a Senior Project Manager. Your phone buzzes. It's an email from your direct report, Maria, who leads the design team for your high-stakes 'Project Titan'.

The email reads:
**Subject: URGENT: Project Titan Issue**
**Body:** "Alex, something is wrong. I just saw the latest client feedback report that was sent out on Friday afternoon. The client *hates* the primary user interface designs. They've called them 'unintuitive' and 'a step backwards.' I'm really worried about tomorrow's stakeholder meeting. This could derail everything."

You feel a knot form in your stomach. This is the last thing you wanted to see before the week even starts. What do you do right now?

1.  Immediately call Maria to get the full story and reassure her that you'll handle it together.
2.  Reply to the email telling Maria not to worry and that you'll look at the report first thing in the morning. You want to see the data for yourself before reacting.
3.  Acknowledge her email with a brief reply: "Thanks for the flag. Let's connect at 8:30 AM tomorrow before the meeting to form a plan." You decide not to let it ruin your Sunday night.
4.  Don't reply yet. You open the client feedback report on your phone to read it thoroughly yourself, wanting to have a complete picture before even speaking to Maria.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*
