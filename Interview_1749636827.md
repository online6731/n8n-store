 

Welcome, Alex. This is an advanced assessment designed to understand your approach to complex workplace situations. We will walk through 10 distinct scenarios at Innovate Inc. Your responses will shape how events unfold. There are no right or wrong answers; simply respond as you genuinely would.

Let's begin with Scenario 1.

It's 9:47 PM on a Sunday. You're winding down, preparing for the week ahead as a Senior Project Manager. Your phone buzzes. It's an email from your direct report, Maria, who leads the design team for your high-stakes 'Project Titan'.

The email reads:
**Subject: URGENT: Project Titan Issue**
**Body:** "Alex, something is wrong. I just saw the latest client feedback report that was sent out on Friday afternoon. The client *hates* the primary user interface designs. They've called them 'unintuitive' and 'a step backwards.' I'm really worried about tomorrow's stakeholder meeting. This could derail everything."

You feel a knot form in your stomach. This is the last thing you wanted to see before the week even starts. What do you do right now?

1.  Immediately call Maria to get the full story and reassure her that you'll handle it together.
2.  Reply to the email telling Maria not to worry and that you'll look at the report first thing in the morning. You want to see the data for yourself before reacting.
3.  Acknowledge her email with a brief reply: "Thanks for the flag. Let's connect at 8:30 AM tomorrow before the meeting to form a plan." You decide not to let it ruin your Sunday night.
4.  Don't reply yet. You open the client feedback report on your phone to read it thoroughly yourself, wanting to have a complete picture before even speaking to Maria.

You tap Maria's name and the phone begins to ring. She picks up on the first ring, her voice tense.

"Alex, thanks so much for calling. I'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday, I was just... I'm looking at this report and my stomach just dropped. They said the user flow 'feels like a maze' and that the color palette is 'unprofessional'. After all the work we put in... I feel completely blindsided. The big presentation is tomorrow at 10 AM. What are we going to do?"

1.  "Take a deep breath, Maria. This is feedback, not a final verdict. Your team does excellent work, and we'll figure this out together. Don't worry about the meeting just yet."
2.  "Okay, let's get tactical. Can you forward me the report? Let's spend the next hour on a video call, go through the feedback point-by-point, and rework our presentation slides for tomorrow."
3.  "This is tough, but manageable. We need a calm, strategic plan. Let's agree to meet at 8 AM tomorrow with the sole purpose of outlining our response. We'll acknowledge their points and present a clear path to address them."
4.  "Listen, this is a major blow. Let's be realistic. We can't solve this tonight. Try to get some rest. We'll just have to go into the meeting tomorrow, take the heat, and promise to do better."
