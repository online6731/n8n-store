Welcome, Alex. The stage is set. Your simulation begins now.

**(Narrator)**

The insistent chirping of your alarm cuts through the quiet hum of your apartment. It's 7:00 AM. Another Monday dawns, and with it, another week at Innovate Solutions. You roll over, groggy but already feeling the familiar pull of the day's agenda. Today is particularly important: the big client prep meeting for the "Quantum Leap" project is at 9:30 AM, and you're leading the competitive analysis section. You need to be sharp.

The scent of brewing coffee (if you remembered to set the timer) or the faint city sounds outside your window beckon you towards the day. You've got a little over two hours until the meeting.

What's your first move?

1.  Hit snooze for ten more minutes of precious sleep.
2.  Immediately hop out of bed and head for the shower.
3.  Grab your phone to check emails and news before getting up.
4.  Stretch and do a quick mental run-through of the Quantum Leap project.

**(Narrator)**

You swing your legs out of bed, the initial grogginess quickly replaced by a focused determination. A quick, invigorating shower does wonders to shake off the remnants of sleep, leaving you feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day.

By the time you've dried off and are standing in front of your closet, it's 7:35 AM. You've made good progress on your morning routine, but there's still a bit of time before you need to leave for the office. The "Quantum Leap" meeting is looming, and you want to ensure you're fully prepared.

What's your next step?

1.  Pick out your most professional power suit â€“ first impressions count, especially today.
2.  Opt for smart casual; Innovate Solutions is a bit more relaxed, and comfort helps focus.
3.  Quickly review the "Quantum Leap" project brief on your tablet while you get dressed.
4.  Head to the kitchen to make a quick breakfast and coffee.
