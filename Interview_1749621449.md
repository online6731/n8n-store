Welcome, Alex. The stage is set. Your simulation begins now.

**(Narrator)**

The insistent chirping of your alarm cuts through the quiet hum of your apartment. It's 7:00 AM. Another Monday dawns, and with it, another week at Innovate Solutions. You roll over, groggy but already feeling the familiar pull of the day's agenda. Today is particularly important: the big client prep meeting for the "Quantum Leap" project is at 9:30 AM, and you're leading the competitive analysis section. You need to be sharp.

The scent of brewing coffee (if you remembered to set the timer) or the faint city sounds outside your window beckon you towards the day. You've got a little over two hours until the meeting.

What's your first move?

1.  Hit snooze for ten more minutes of precious sleep.
2.  Immediately hop out of bed and head for the shower.
3.  Grab your phone to check emails and news before getting up.
4.  Stretch and do a quick mental run-through of the Quantum Leap project.

You can select 1, 2, 3, 4, or type your own course of action.
