 

Welcome.

To begin the simulation, I require an `initialContext` JSON object to configure the environment. Please provide this information.

Here is an example format:
```json
{
  "candidateName": "Jordan Smith",
  "jobRole": "Lead UX Designer",
  "companyName": "Future-Proof Solutions"
}
```

Once you provide the context, the simulation will begin immediately.
 

```json
{
  "candidateName": "Emily Clark",
  "jobRole": "Software Engineer",
  "companyName": "InnovateTech"
}
```
 

Hello, Emily Clark. Welcome to your interview for the Software Engineer position at InnovateTech.

My name is Kai, and I will be guiding you through this assessment. This is a dynamic simulation designed to understand how you approach real-world situations you might encounter in your role. We will proceed through 10 distinct scenarios. Your responses will shape the narrative and the outcomes. There are no right or wrong answers, only your authentic approach.

Let's begin.

**Scenario 1 of 10**

It's a Tuesday morning. You're at your desk, deep in focus on a complex bug fix, when an email notification pops up. It's from Mark, a senior engineer on your team who is respected for his technical skills but is known to be very direct. He was responsible for reviewing your latest code submission for a critical new user authentication module.

The email reads:

**Subject:** Code Review Feedback
**To:** Emily Clark
**From:** Mark Jensen

Hi Emily,

I've reviewed your latest commit for the user authentication module. There are several fundamental issues with the approach that need to be addressed before it can be merged.

Let's discuss.

Mark

What is your immediate next action?

1.  Reply to the email immediately, asking for more specific details about the "fundamental issues" and explaining the reasoning behind your chosen approach.
2.  Take a deep breath. Acknowledge the email with a quick "Thanks, will review," and then spend 15-20 minutes re-reading your own code to see if you can identify the potential issues Mark is referring to.
3.  Feel a flash of annoyance. Mark can be overly critical. You decide to finish the bug fix you're currently working on first; the feedback can wait an hour or two.
4.  Get up and walk directly over to Mark's desk to ask him to elaborate on his feedback in person.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*

You send a quick, polite reply to Mark acknowledging his email.

Taking a moment to regulate your initial reaction, you pull up your code submission. You spend the next 20 minutes carefully reviewing every line. You spot a couple of minor inefficiencies and a potential edge case you hadn't considered, but you can't find anything you would classify as a "fundamental issue." The core logic seems sound based on the project requirements as you understood them.

Your initial self-review is complete, but Mark's vague feedback still looms. How do you re-engage with him?

1.  Walk over to Mark's desk with your laptop. "Hi Mark, thanks for the feedback. I've reviewed my code and found a few things, but I'm struggling to see the fundamental issues you mentioned. Could you walk me through your concerns when you have a moment?"
2.  Reply to the email thread with a detailed breakdown of your self-review, outlining the minor issues you found, and ask him to specify which parts he considers fundamental problems.
3.  Go to his desk and start by explaining why your architectural choice is correct according to the project specs, putting the onus on him to prove you wrong.
4.  Wait for Mark to bring it up again. He said he wanted to discuss it, so the ball is in his court. You'll work on other things until he reaches out.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*
