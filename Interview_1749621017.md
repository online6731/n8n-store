**(The Director's Lens: Establishing the Scene)**

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a hint of lemon cleaning spray, and the low hum of distant chatter fill the air. It's 8:45 AM, and the Innovate Solutions office is slowly coming to life. Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air above polished desks. You are Alex, a bright and ambitious Junior Consultant, ready to tackle another day at the heart of corporate innovation. Your desk, meticulously organized, awaits your touch, a single sticky note reminding you of a 9:00 AM check-in with your Project Lead, Sarah Jenkins.

As you settle into your ergonomic chair, booting up your dual monitors, you notice a quick message from David, the Senior Consultant on your current project, the "Synergy Streamline" initiative for Apex Corp. It's a quick note: "Morning, Alex. Could you give a quick once-over to the Q3 budget draft I uploaded to the team drive before our check-in? Just a high-level scan for any glaring issues. Thanks!"

Sarah's check-in is imminent, and David's request just landed. You also remember that your calendar flagged a follow-up email to a potential client about the "Innovate Catalyst" package.

What do you do first?

1.  Prioritize David's request and quickly review the budget draft, knowing Sarah's meeting is about to start.
2.  Head directly to Sarah's desk or the meeting room to prepare for your 9:00 AM check-in.
3.  Quickly draft and send the follow-up email to the potential client, then address David's request or Sarah's meeting.
4.  Open your digital calendar to meticulously review your schedule for the entire day, planning your time.
