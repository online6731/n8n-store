**(The Director's Lens: Establishing the Scene)**

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a hint of lemon cleaning spray, and the low hum of distant chatter fill the air. It's 8:45 AM, and the Innovate Solutions office is slowly coming to life. Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air above polished desks. You are Alex, a bright and ambitious Junior Consultant, ready to tackle another day at the heart of corporate innovation. Your desk, meticulously organized, awaits your touch, a single sticky note reminding you of a 9:00 AM check-in with your Project Lead, Sarah Jenkins.

As you settle into your ergonomic chair, booting up your dual monitors, you notice a quick message from David, the Senior Consultant on your current project, the "Synergy Streamline" initiative for Apex Corp. It's a quick note: "Morning, Alex. Could you give a quick once-over to the Q3 budget draft I uploaded to the team drive before our check-in? Just a high-level scan for any glaring issues. Thanks!"

Sarah's check-in is imminent, and David's request just landed. You also remember that your calendar flagged a follow-up email to a potential client about the "Innovate Catalyst" package.

What do you do first?

1.  Prioritize David's request and quickly review the budget draft, knowing Sarah's meeting is about to start.
2.  Head directly to Sarah's desk or the meeting room to prepare for your 9:00 AM check-in.
3.  Quickly draft and send the follow-up email to the potential client, then address David's request or Sarah's meeting.
4.  Open your digital calendar to meticulously review your schedule for the entire day, planning your time.

As Alex, a Junior Consultant, I understand the importance of being responsive to senior colleagues and preparing for scheduled meetings. David's request is explicit: "before our check-in," implying a quick task that needs to be done in the next few minutes. Sarah's check-in is equally important for project progress.

I choose to **prioritize David's request and quickly review the budget draft**. A "quick once-over for glaring issues" suggests it's a high-level scan, not a deep dive. I'll open the document, scan for any obvious anomalies or errors, and make a mental note of anything that jumps out. This shows I'm proactive and responsive to senior team members, setting me up to be prepared for Sarah's check-in by being aware of this immediate team need. The client email can wait a few more minutes; it's not time-sensitive to the 9:00 AM window.

The digital clock shows **8:55 AM**. I've quickly scanned the budget draft, noting a couple of figures that might warrant a second look later, but nothing "glaring" that requires immediate action or a delay to Sarah's meeting. My screen is clear, and I'm ready to transition to the check-in.

What will you do in these final five minutes before your 9:00 AM check-in with Sarah Jenkins?

1.  **Head to Sarah's desk/meeting room now:** Arrive early and be fully prepared.
2.  **Quickly review your notes for the Synergy Streamline project:** Refresh your memory on key points for the check-in.
3.  **Draft a quick reply to David:** Acknowledge his request and confirm the quick review.
4.  **Grab a glass of water:** Stay hydrated for the day ahead.
You efficiently execute the quick budget scan, a testament to your growing ability to triage tasks effectively. The clock on your monitor confirms it: **8:55 AM**. You've got five minutes before your 9:00 AM check-in with Sarah Jenkins. The hum of the office around you is still gentle, a precursor to the day's full energy.
