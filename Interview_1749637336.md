 

Hello, and welcome to the Innovatech Solutions EI Assessment.

My name is a.i., your guide for this simulation. You will navigate through 10 realistic work-life scenarios designed to understand your approach to professional challenges. There are no right or wrong answers; simply respond as you genuinely would. We will begin now.

**Scenario 1: The Missed Deadline**

You are a Senior Project Manager at Innovatech Solutions, leading a high-stakes project, 'Project Chimera'. It's Monday morning. You've just noticed that Sarah, your brilliant but occasionally overwhelmed Lead Developer, has missed a critical deadline for a key component that was due Friday evening. This delay puts the entire project timeline at risk. Sarah hasn't sent any messages or updates over the weekend. You see her at her desk, looking stressed and focused.

What is your first step?

1. Walk over to Sarah's desk immediately and ask for a status update on the overdue component.
2. Send Sarah a brief, friendly chat message: "Hey Sarah, got a minute to chat when you're free? No rush."
3. Send a formal email to Sarah, copying your own manager, asking for a written explanation for the missed deadline and a new ETA.
4. Decide to wait a couple of hours. She might be preparing an update and you don't want to add to her stress.

*You can select an option by typing its number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or write your own response.*

A few seconds after you send the message, you see Sarah glance at her monitor. Her shoulders, which were tense, seem to relax slightly. A 'typing...' indicator appears in your chat window, and then a message pops up.

**Sarah:** "Hi. Yeah, absolutely. I'm so sorry about the radio silence. Can you meet me in Conference Room 3 in about 15 minutes? I'll book it now. I'd prefer to explain in person."

How do you reply?

1.  "Sounds good, see you there."
2.  "No problem. Before we meet, can you quickly tell me if the component is almost done or if we're looking at a major delay?"
3.  "15 minutes works. Please come prepared with a full recovery plan."
4.  "Can we just discuss it over chat? It might be quicker."
